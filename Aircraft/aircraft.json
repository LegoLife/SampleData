					"The IAE V2500 is a two-shaft high-bypass turbofan engine built by International Aero Engines (IAE) which powers the Airbus A320 family, the McDonnell Douglas MD-90, and the Embraer C-390 Millennium.",
					"The engine's name is a combination of the Roman numeral V, symbolizing the five original members of the International Aero Engines consortium, which was formed in 1983 to produce the V2500 engine. The 2500 represents the 25,000-pound-force (110 kN) produced by the original engine model, the V2500-A1. FAA type certification for the V2500 was granted in 1988.",
					"The maintenance, repair, and operations market for V2500 is close to US$3 billion as of 2015.",
					"Rolls-Royce based the 10-stage HP compressor on an 8-stage run in the RB401 in the mid 1970's followed by a 9-stage run in the RJ.500. The V.2500 would use 10 stages, with the first 4 with variable stators, giving a pressure ratio of 20:1. A single-stage booster was also part of the original configuration. Serious handling problems (inability to accelerate without surging) with this arrangement resulted in a redesigned compression system. The pressure ratio was reduced to 16:1 which needed a fifth variable stage and revised blading in the rear stages. Two extra booster stages were required to restore the original overall pressure ratio. A fourth booster stage would be added after the initial variant entered service. Pratt & Whitney developed the combustor and the 2-stage air-cooled HP turbine, while the Japanese Aero Engine Corporation provided the LP compression system. MTU Aero Engines were responsible for the 5-stage LP turbine and Fiat Avio designed the gearbox.",
					"In 1989, its unit cost was US$4.7 million, US$11.1M today. The 4,000th V2500 was delivered in August 2009 to the Brazilian flag carrier TAM and installed on the 4,000th Airbus A320 family aircraft, an A319. In early 2012, the 5,000th V2500 engine was delivered to SilkAir, and IAE achieved 100 million flying hours. Six years later, in June 2018, over 7,600 engines were delivered and the V2500 achieved 200 million flight hours on 3,100 aircraft in service.",
					"The original version, has 1 fan stage, 3 LP booster stages, 10 HPC stages, 2 HPT stages, and 5 LPT stages. This engine promised better fuel burn on the Airbus A320 than the competing CFM56-5A; however, initial reliability issues, coupled with insufficient thrust for the larger A321, prompted the development of the improved V2500-A5 variant. It first entered service with Cyprus Airways",
					"A fourth booster stage was introduced into the engine basic configuration to increase core flow. This, together with a minor fan diameter and airflow increase, helped to increase the maximum thrust to 33,000 lbf (147 kN) thrust, to meet the requirements of the larger Airbus A321. Soon, Airbus offered derated versions of the V2500-A5 on the Airbus A319 and Airbus A320, enabling the same engine hardware to be used across all Airbus A320 family aircraft, with the exception of the Airbus A318. The vast majority of V2500s are of the A5 variety.",
					"This engine retains the configuration of the V2500-A5, but is fitted with different mounting hardware and accessory gearboxes to facilitate installation on the McDonnell Douglas MD-90.",
					"This engine retains the configuration of the V2500-A5, but is fitted with different mounting hardware and accessory gearboxes to facilitate installation on the Embraer KC-390.",
					"A number of de-rated, Stage 4 noise compliant engines have been produced from the -A5 configuration, as well as two variants with significant increase in thrust, thus expanding the thrust range from 23,500 lbf to 33,000 lbf:",
					"On October 10, 2005, IAE announced the launch of the V2500Select—later called V2500SelectOne—with a sale to IndiGo Airlines to power 100 A320 series aircraft. The V2500SelectOne is a combination performance improvement package and aftermarket agreement. In February 2009, Pratt & Whitney upgraded the first V2500-A5 to the SelectOne Retrofit standard; the engine was owned by US Airways and had been in use since 1998.",
					"On March 15, 2011, IAE announced an upgrade option of V2500 SelectOne Engines to the SelectTwo Program. It offers reduced fuel consumption due to a software-upgrade and Reduced Ground Idle (RGI), and is available since 2014 for the V2500-A5 variants.",

The design traces its history to 1929 experiments at Pratt & Whitney on twin-row designs. Production began in 1932 and it was widely used during the 1930s.",
					"It was selected as the power plant for both the four-engined Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber and the twin-engined Douglas DC-3 transport, two of the most-produced aircraft. The production run of 173,618 R-1830 examples makes it the most-produced aviation engine in history.",
					"A further developed version, the R-2000, was produced starting in 1942. The R-2000 was \"bored-out\" to 5.75 in (146 mm) and had a number of other minor changes to improve fuel economy and allow it to run at higher power ratings on lower-octane fuel. The primary user of the R-2000 was the Douglas DC-4.",
					"Mostly retired today, the R-1830 is still used on Douglas DC-3 and various museum aircraft and warbirds seen at airshows. It is not manufactured anymore, but spares are still available and there is still a market for second-hand engines and parts."

					"The Shenyang WS-10 (Chinese: 涡扇-10; pinyin: Wōshàn-10; lit. 'turbofan-10'), codename Taihang, is a turbofan engine designed and built by the People's Republic of China.",
					"Chinese media reported 266 engines were manufactured from 2010 to 2012 for the J-11 program. Unofficial estimates placed production at more than 300 units by May 2015.",
					"The WS-10A is advertised as an engine with 120–140 kilonewtons (27,000–31,000 lbf) thrust. It has full authority digital engine control (FADEC).",
					"The WS-10 is derived from the CFM56 with the experience gained from the Woshan WS-6 turbofan project, which was abandoned at the start of the 1980s. The WS-10 project was reportedly started by Deng Xiaoping in 1986 to produce an engine comparable to the Saturn AL-31. The work was given to the Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute (606 Institute) of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). Initial production models suffered quality issues from the early direct use of AL-31 control systems. Furthermore, Salyut refused to sell the control system source code, forcing China to spend nearly 20 years developing its own code independently. An early version of the FADEC flew on an J-8II in 2002.",
					"The WS-10A, targeted for 130 kilonewtons (29,000 lbf) of thrust, was already in development in 2002. In 2004, Russian sources familiar with project reported problems meeting the thrust target; in 2005, they reported problems reducing the weight of the primary and secondary compressors, in addition to problems meeting thrust requirements. Engine testing on the J-11 had already started by 2004, and testing using one engine on the J-11 may have occurred as early as 2002.",
					"A full-scale WS-10A engine was first seen at the 2008 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.",
					"In 2009, Western media claim that the WS-10A approached the performance of the AL-31, but took much longer than the AL-31 to develop thrust. Furthermore, the engine reportedly only generated 110–125 kilonewtons (25,000–28,000 lbf) of thrust. In April 2009, Lin Zuoming, head of AVIC, reported that the engine's quality was unsatisfactory. In 2010, it was reported that reliability was also poor; the WS-10A lasted only 30 hours, while the AL-31 needed refurbishing after 400 hours. The quality problems encountered with the WS-10A reflected the state of the Chinese aerospace industry. AVIC initiated a general effort to improve quality control throughout its production chain in 2011.",
					"The WS-10A reportedly matured enough after 2009 to power the twin-engined J-11B Block 02 aircraft. Production or performance issues may have prevented the WS-10A from powering the single-engined J-10B. In 2018, Chinese state media reported an increase in engine lifespan from 800 to 1,500 hours due to the increased heat resistance of new third-generation single-crystal turbine blades.",
					"In March 2020, Chinese state media released a video showing a WS-10B-powered J-10C; aircraft markings suggest it was part of the fourth batch of J-10Cs for the PLAAF.",
					"The WS-10 has also powered various versions of the Chengdu J-20. The WS-10B reportedly powered low rate initial production aircraft in 2015, and was used as an interim engine before the adoption of the AL-31. In 2019, the Xian WS-15 – the J-20's intended engine – failed trials, leading to the decision to replace the AL-31 with the WS-10C as the interim engine; reportedly, the AL-31 was unacceptable because Russia refused to sell additional engines unless China also bought the Sukhoi Su-35 as well. Testing was underway by November 2020. In June 2021, Chinese media confirmed that the WS-10C was powering operational J-20As. In January 2022, it was reported that J-20's powered by the WS-10C would be upgraded with TVC.",
					"The original WS-10A has a thrust-to-weight ratio of 7.5, the improved WS-10B is rated approximately 9.0, while the WS-10C is capable of 9.5 or higher — adequate for the Chengdu J-20 to be capable of supercruise.",
					"In November 2022, a production Shenyang J-15 powered by the WS-10, possible the WS-10B, appeared in Chinese media. It was the last indigenous Chinese combat aircraft to replace the AL-31; possibly due to navalisation. According to Chinese observers, compared to the AL-31 the WS-10 had superior safety, reliability, and service life, aspects which are magnified by the constraints of carrier aviation. The replacement reflected continuing improvements in China's aviation engine industry.",
					"The Shenyang WS-20 (WS-188) is a high-bypass engine, reportedly producing 13.8 tons of thrust. It is believed to be based on the core of the WS-10A.",
					"The Shenyang WS-20 is believed to be intended for the Y-20 strategic airlifter.",
					"A testbed J-10B powered by a WS-10 with thrust vectoring (TVC) – called \"WS-10B-3\" by Jamie Hunter – was demonstrated at the 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. The TVC nozzle uses actuator-assisted moving petals, similar in concept to General Electric's axisymmetric vectoring exhaust nozzle (AVEN) and Pratt & Whitney's pitch-yaw balance beam nozzle (PYBBN)."

Based on the TF39, the first high-power high-bypass jet engine, the CF6 powers a wide variety of civilian airliners. The basic engine core also powers the LM2500 and LM6000 marine and power generation turboshafts. It is gradually being replaced by the newer GEnx family.",
					"After developing the TF39 for the C-5 Galaxy in the late 1960s, GE offered a more powerful variant for civilian use, the CF6, and quickly found interest in two designs being offered for a recent Eastern Airlines contract, the Lockheed L-1011 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Lockheed eventually selected the Rolls-Royce RB211, but the latter stuck with the CF6 and entered service in 1971. It was also selected for versions of the Boeing 747. Since then, the CF6 has powered versions of the Airbus A300, A310 and A330, Boeing 767, and McDonnell Douglas MD-11.",
					"The high bypass of the CF6 represented a historic breakthrough in fuel efficiency.",
					"By 2018, GE has delivered more than 8,300 CF6s: 480 -6s, 2,200 -50s, 4,400 -80C2s, more than 730 -80E; and 3,000 LM6000 industrial and marine derivatives.The in-service fleet include 3,400 engines, more than all the GE90s and GEnx, generating over 600 shop visits per year.GE will be delivering engines well into the 2020s and they will fly for 20 to 25 years, until 2045-50: more than 75 years since the first CF6.",
					"As express delivery spurs an air cargo resurgence, Boeing plans to increase the CF6-80C2-powered 767 delivery rate from 2.5 to 3 per month in 2020, a type introduced in 1982.As CF6-80E1s are still delivered for the Airbus A330 and Airbus A330 MRTT, CF6 production will grow from 50 to 60-80 per year by 2020.GE also studies reengining the Progress D-18-powered Antonov An-124 freighters with CargoLogicAir, a Volga-Dnepr subsidiary.This would likely provide a range increase, and Volga-Dnepr Group operates 12 aircraft, implying a 50-60 engines with spares program.",
					"The CF6-6 was first used on the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10.",
					"This initial version of the CF6 has a single-stage fan with one core booster stage, driven by a 5-stage LP (low pressure) turbine, turbocharging a 16-stage HP (high pressure) axial compressor driven by a 2-stage HP turbine; the combustor is annular; separate exhaust nozzles are used for the fan and core airflows. The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300 lb/s (590 kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500 lb (185.05 kN).",
					"The General Electric CF6-32 was to be a lower thrust derivative of the CF6-6 for the Boeing 757.  In 1981, GE formally abandoned development of the engine, leaving the Boeing 757 engine market to Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.",
					"The CF6-50 series are high-bypass turbofan engines rated between 51,000 and 54,000 lb (227.41 to 240.79 kN, or '25 tons') of thrust. The CF6-50 was developed into the LM5000 industrial turboshaft engines. It was launched in 1969 to power the long range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, and was derived from the earlier CF6-6.",
					"Not long after the -6 entered service, an increase in thrust was required. It was obtained by increasing the mass flow through the core. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor and the last two stages of the HP compressor were removed which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450 lb/s (660 kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000 lbf (227 kN). The increase in core flow decreased the bypass ratio to 4.26.",
					"In late 1969, the CF6-50 was selected to power the then new Airbus A300. Air France became the launch customer for the A300 by ordering six aircraft in 1971. In 1975, KLM became the first airline to order the Boeing 747 powered by the CF6-50. This led further developments to the CF6 family such as the CF6-80. The CF6-50 also powered the Boeing YC-14 USAF AMST transport prototype.",
					"The basic CF6-50 engine was also offered with a 10% thrust derate for the 747SR, a short-range high-cycle version used by All Nippon Airways for domestic Japanese operations. This engine is termed the CF6-45.",
					"The engine is designated the General Electric F103 in United States Air Force service on KC-10 Extenders and Boeing E-4s.",
					"The CF6-80 series are high-bypass turbofan engines with a thrust range of 48,000 to 75,000 lb (214 to 334 kN).  Although the HP compressor still has 14 stages, GE did take the opportunity to tidy-up the design, by removing the empty air passage at compressor exit.[citation needed]",
					"The -80 series is divided into four distinct models.",
					"The CF6-80A, which has a thrust rating of 48,000 to 50,000 lb (214 to 222 kN), powered two twinjets, the Boeing 767 and Airbus A310. The GE-powered 767 entered airline service in 1982, and the GE powered A310 in early 1983. It is rated for ETOPS operations.",
					"For the CF6-80A/A1, the fan diameter remains at 86.4 in (2.19 m), with an airflow of 1435 lb/s (651 kg/s). Overall pressure ratio is 28.0, with a bypass ratio of 4.66. Static thrust is 48,000 lbf (214 kN). The basic mechanical configuration is the same as the -50 series.",
					"For the CF6-80C2-A1, the fan diameter is increased to 93 in (2.36 m), with an airflow of 1750 lb/s (790 kg/s). Overall pressure ratio is 30.4, with a bypass ratio of 5.15. Static thrust is 59,000 lb (263 kN). An extra stage is added to the LP compressor, and a 5th to the LP turbine.",
					"The CF6-80C2 is currently certified on fifteen commercial and military widebody aircraft models including the Boeing 747-400, and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The CF6-80C2 is also certified for ETOPS-180 for the Airbus A300, Airbus A310, Boeing 767, KC-767A/J, E-767J, Kawasaki C-2, and (as the F138) the Lockheed C-5M Super Galaxy and VC-25A.",
					"The F138-100 is a military designation of the CF6-80C2. This engine is a modification of the CF6-80C2 to produce 50,400–51,600 lbf, with Strict Noise Regulations and Green Emissions, specially and specifically designed for Lockheed Martin C-5M Super Galaxy",
					"The CF6-80E1 has the highest thrust power of CF6-80 Series family, with the fan tip diameters increased to 96.2 in (2.443m), and an overall pressure ratio of 32.6 and bypass ratio of 5.3.   The 68,000 to 72,000 lbf (300 to 320 kN) variant competes with the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 and the Pratt & Whitney PW4000 to power the Airbus A330.",
					"The industrial and marine development of the CF6-80C2, the LM6000 Series, has found wide use including fast ferry and high speed cargo ship applications, as well as in power generation. The LM6000 gas turbine family provides power in the 40 to 56 MW range for utility, industrial, and oil & gas applications.",
					"According to Bloomberg, European aviation regulators have determined that London-based AOG Technics, majority owned by Jose Zamora Yrala, whose nationality is listed as British on some forms and Venezuelan on others, supplied parts of unknown origin and false documents for repairs on CF6's.",
					"In 1973, a CF6-6 fan assembly disintegrated, resulting in the loss of cabin pressurization of National Airlines Flight 27 over New Mexico, United States.",
					"In 1979 a CF6-6 engine detached from the left wing of American Airlines Flight 191 due to faulty pylon maintenance, severing hydraulic lines and causing the aircraft to crash.",
					"In 1989, a CF6-6 fan disk separated from the engine and damaged all three hydraulic systems. The flight, United Airlines Flight 232, continued with no hydraulic power until it crash-landed at the airport in Sioux City, Iowa.",
					"In 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) warned that the high-pressure compressor could crack.",
					"Following a series of high-pressure turbine failures on 6 September 1997, 7 June 2000 and 8 December 2002, and resulting in 767s being written off on 22 September 2000, on 2 June 2006, and on 28 October 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive mandating inspections for over 600 engines and the NTSB believed that this number should be increased to include all -80 series engines with more than 3000 cycles since new or since last inspection.",
					"In May 2010, The NTSB warned that the low-pressure turbine rotor disks could fail. Four uncontained failures of CF6-45/50 engines in the preceding two years prompted it to issue an \"urgent\" recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft : none of the four incidents of rotor disk imbalance and subsequent failure resulted in an accident, but parts of the engine did penetrate the engine housing in each case."

				"data": [
					"The Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior is a series of nine-cylinder, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines built by the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company from the 1930s to the 1950s. These engines have a displacement of 985 in3 (16 L); initial versions produced 300 hp (220 kW), while the most widely used versions produce 450 hp (340 kW).",
					"Wasp Juniors have powered numerous smaller civil and military aircraft, including small transports, utility aircraft, trainers, agricultural aircraft, and helicopters. Over 39,000 engines were built, and many are still in service today.",
					"Pratt & Whitney developed the R-985 Wasp Junior as a smaller version of the R-1340 Wasp to compete in the market for medium-sized aircraft engines. Like its larger brother, the Wasp Junior was an air-cooled, nine-cylinder radial, with its power boosted by a gear-driven single-speed centrifugal type supercharger. Its cylinders were smaller, however, with a bore and stroke of .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}5+3⁄16 in (132 mm), giving a 27% lesser total displacement. The Wasp Junior used many parts from the Wasp and even had the same mounting dimensions, allowing an aircraft to easily use either the smaller or the larger engine. The first run of the Wasp Junior was in 1929, and sales began in 1930. The initial version, the Wasp Junior A, produced 300 hp (224 kW).",
					"The U.S. military designated the Wasp Junior as the R-985, with various suffixes denoting different military engine models. However, Pratt & Whitney never adopted the R-985 designation scheme for its civilian Wasp Juniors, identifying them simply by name and model (e.g. \"Wasp Junior A\").",
					"Pratt & Whitney followed the Wasp Junior A with more powerful models in the \"A series\". These had higher compression ratios, greater RPM limits, and more effective supercharging, and they led to the \"B series\". The first B series model was the Wasp Junior TB, which could maintain 420 hp (310 kW) at sea level and could reach 440 hp (330 kW) for takeoff. The TB was tuned for best performance at sea level; it was soon joined by the Wasp Junior SB, which was tuned for best performance at altitude and could sustain 400 hp (300 kW) at altitudes up to 5,000 ft (1,500 m), with 450 hp (340 kW) available for takeoff.  A still later model, the Wasp Junior T1B2, had improved performance at low level, being able to sustain 450 hp (340 kW) up to 1,500 ft (460 m) while still matching the SB's power at high altitudes. The SB and T1B2, and later versions of these with similar performance, were the most popular Wasp Junior models. One later development of the T1B2, the Wasp Junior B4, was especially designed for vertical mounting in helicopters.",
					"During the mid-1930s, Pratt & Whitney developed a still greater improvement of the Wasp Junior, the \"C series\", with an even higher compression ratio and RPM limit. The only type produced in this series, the Wasp Junior SC-G, could sustain 525 hp (391 kW) at an altitude of 9,500 ft (2,900 m) and could produce 600 hp (450 kW) for takeoff. It also included reduction gearing to allow the high-revving engine to drive a propeller at suitable speeds, hence the \"-G\" suffix. Aviator Jacqueline Cochran flew a special Model D-17W Beechcraft Staggerwing with this engine in 1937, setting a speed and altitude record and placing third in the Bendix transcontinental race. However, the SC-G never got past the experimental stage.",
					"Early versions of the Wasp Junior were used in various small civilian and military utility aircraft, but only in limited numbers.  The type became more popular later in the 1930s. It was selected for the Lockheed Model 10A Electra twin-engined airliner, as well as for other small twin-engined civil transports like the Lockheed Model 12A Electra Junior, the Beechcraft Model 18, and the Grumman Goose amphibious aircraft. It was also used in single-engined civilian utility aircraft like the Beechcraft Staggerwing, the Howard DGA-15, and the Spartan Executive.",
					"As World War II arrived, the U.S. military chose the Wasp Junior for the Vultee BT-13 Valiant and North American BT-14 basic training aircraft and for the Vought OS2U Kingfisher observation floatplane. Military versions of existing Wasp Junior-powered civilian aircraft were also produced, such as the military derivatives of the Beech 18, Beech Staggerwing, Grumman Goose, and Howard DGA-15. The Wasp Junior also powered some versions of the British Avro Anson and Airspeed Oxford twin-engined trainers. The demands of World War II led to the production of many thousands of Wasp Juniors.",
					"Until the end of the war, the Wasp Junior's closest competitor was Wright Aeronautical's R-975 Whirlwind. However, during the war, the Wasp Junior was far more widely used in aircraft than the R-975, and Wright ceased production of the R-975 in 1945.",
					"After World War II, many military-surplus aircraft with Wasp Junior engines entered the civilian market. New designs based on the Wasp Junior were also introduced, such as the Sikorsky H-5 helicopter, the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, and Max Holste Broussard bush airplanes, and agricultural aircraft such as the Snow S-2B and S-2C, Grumman Ag Cat, and Weatherley 201.",
					"Pratt & Whitney ceased production of the Wasp Junior in 1953, having built 39,037 engines. Many Wasp Junior engines are still in use today in older bush planes and agricultural planes, as well as in antique aircraft. Some antique aircraft, such as the Boeing-Stearman Model 75, which originally used other engines, have had them replaced with the Wasp Junior to provide more power or for easier maintenance, since parts for the Wasp Junior are readily available.",

				"name": "CFM_International_CFM56",
				"data": [
					"The CFM International CFM56 (U.S. military designation F108) series is a Franco-American family of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines made by CFM International (CFMI), with a thrust range of 18,500 to 34,000 lbf (82 to 150 kN). CFMI is a 50–50 joint-owned company of Safran Aircraft Engines (formerly known as Snecma) of France, and GE Aerospace (GE) of the United States. Both companies are responsible for producing components and each has its own final assembly line. GE produces the high-pressure compressor, combustor, and high-pressure turbine, Safran manufactures the fan, gearbox, exhaust and the low-pressure turbine, and some components are made by Avio of Italy and Honeywell from the US. The engines are assembled by GE in Evendale, Ohio, and by Safran in Villaroche, France. The completed engines are marketed by CFMI. Despite initial export restrictions, it is the most used turbofan aircraft engine in the world, in four major variants.",
					"The CFM56 first ran in 1974. By April 1979, the joint venture had not received a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved. The program was saved when Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Flying Tigers chose the CFM56 to re-engine their DC-8s and shortly thereafter it was chosen to re-engine the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker fleet of the U.S. Air Force. The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan blade failure incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both of these issues were resolved with engine modifications.",
					"Research into the next generation of commercial jet engines, high-bypass ratio turbofans in the \"10-ton\" (20,000 lbf; 89 kN) thrust class, began in the late 1960s. Snecma (now Safran), who had mostly built military engines previously, was the first company to seek entrance into the market by searching for a partner with commercial experience to design and build an engine in this class. They considered Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and GE Aviation as potential partners, and after two company executives, Gerhard Neumann from GE and René Ravaud from Snecma, introduced themselves at the 1971 Paris Air Show a decision was made. The two companies saw mutual benefit in the collaboration and met several more times, fleshing out the basics of the joint project.",
					"At the time, Pratt & Whitney dominated the commercial market. GE needed an engine in this market class, and Snecma had previous experience of working with them, collaborating on the production of the CF6-50 turbofan for the Airbus A300. Pratt & Whitney was considering upgrading their JT8D to compete in the same class as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.",
					"A major reason for GE's interest in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the Snecma project was the only source of development funds for an engine in this class at this particular time. GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber. The company was faced with a dilemma when the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding for the development of a 10-ton engine – either to build a \"limited\" technology 10-ton engine with Snecma, or a similar engine with \"advanced\" technology on their own. Concerned that the company would be left with only the \"limited\" engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt & Whitney and a General Motors division with its \"advanced\" engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.",
					"GE applied for the export license in 1972 as their primary contribution to the 10-ton engine project. The United States Department of State's Office of Munitions Control recommended the rejection of the application on national security grounds; specifically because the core technology was an aspect of a strategic national defense system (B-1 bomber), it was built with Department of Defense funding, and that exporting the technology to France would limit the number of American workers on the project. The official decision was made in a National Security Decision Memorandum signed by the National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger on 19 September 1972.",
					"While national security concerns were cited as the grounds for rejection, politics played an important role as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if Snecma pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be the beginning of the end of American aerospace leadership.",
					"There was also speculation that the rejection may have been, in part, retaliation for French involvement in convincing the Swiss not to purchase American-made LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft that had been competing against a French design, the Dassault Milan. In the end, the Swiss did not purchase either aircraft, opting for the Northrop F-5E Tiger II instead.",
					"Despite the export license being rejected, both the French and GE continued to push the Nixon Administration for permission to export the F101 technology. Efforts continued throughout the months following the rejection, culminating in the engine becoming an agenda topic during the 1973 meeting of Presidents Nixon and Pompidou in Reykjavík. Discussions at this meeting resulted in an agreement that allowed the development of the CFM56 to proceed. Contemporary reports state that the agreement was based on assurances that the core of the engine, the part that GE was developing from the military F101, would be built in the U.S. and then transported to France in order to protect the sensitive technologies. The joint venture also agreed to pay the U.S. an $80 million royalty fee (calculated at $20,000 per engine predicted to be built) as repayment for the development money provided by the government for the F101 engine core. Documents declassified in 2007 revealed that a key aspect of the CFM56 export agreement was that the French government agreed not to seek tariffs against American aircraft being imported into Europe.",
					"With the export issue settled, GE and Snecma finalized the agreement that formed CFM International (CFMI), a 50–50 joint company that would be responsible for producing and marketing the 10-ton engine, the CFM56. The venture was officially founded in 1974. The \"CF\" in the engine name stands for GE's designation for commercial turbofan engines, while the \"M56\" is the name of Snecma's original engine proposal. The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and Snecma, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single point of contact for the customer. CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and Snecma management.",
					"The CFMI board of directors is currently split evenly between Snecma and GE (five members each). There are two vice presidents, one from each company, who support the President of CFMI. The president tends to be drawn from Snecma and sits at CFMI's headquarters near GE in Cincinnati, Ohio.",
					"The work split between the two companies gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); Snecma was responsible for the fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). Snecma was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.",
					"Development work on the CFM56 began before CFMI was formally created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core was built in the U.S., then shipped to the Snecma plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of Snecma was not allowed. The Snecma components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.",
					"The first completed CFM56 engine first ran at GE in June 1974 with the second running in October 1974. The second engine was then shipped to France and first ran there on 13 December 1974. These first engines were considered \"production hardware\" as opposed to test examples and were designated as the CFM56-2, the first variant of the CFM56.",
					"The engine flew for the first time in February 1977 when it replaced one of the four Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines on the McDonnell Douglas YC-15, an entrant in the Air Force's Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition. Soon after, the second CFM56 was mounted on a Sud Aviation Caravelle at the Snecma flight test center in France. This engine had a slightly different configuration with a long bypass duct and mixed exhaust flow,[nb 1] rather than a short bypass duct with unmixed exhaust flow.[nb 2] It was the first to include a \"Thrust Management System\".",
					"After testing the engine for several years, both in the air and on the ground, CFMI searched for customers outside of a possible AMST contract. The main targets were re-engine contracts for the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 707 airliners, including the related military tanker, the KC-135 Stratotanker. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 engine for flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from the airlines in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine's competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.",
					"Winning the contract to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF would be a huge boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as the Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.",
					"The USAF announced the CFM56 as the winner of the re-engine contract in January 1980. Officials indicated that they were excited at the prospect of replacing the Pratt & Whitney J57 engines currently flying on the KC-135A aircraft, calling them \"...the noisiest, dirtiest, [and] most fuel inefficient powerplant still flying\" at the time. The re-engined aircraft was designated the KC-135R. The CFM56 brought many benefits to the KC-135, decreasing takeoff distance by as much as 3,500 ft (1,100 m), decreasing overall fuel usage by 25%, greatly reducing noise (24 dB lower) and lowering total life cycle cost. With those benefits in mind, the United States Navy selected the CFM56-2 to power their variant of the Boeing 707, the E-6 Mercury, in 1982. In 1984 the Royal Saudi Air Force selected the CFM56-2 to power their E-3 Sentry aircraft (also related to the 707 airframe). The CFM56-2-powered E-3 also became the standard configuration for aircraft purchased by the British and French.",
					"By the end of the 1970s, airlines were considering upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as an alternative to buying new quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United Airlines to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and Snecma were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial market.",
					"In the early 1980s Boeing selected the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were closer to the ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved from the bottom of the engine (the 6 o'clock position) to the 9 o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from 24,000 to 20,000 lbf (107 to 89 kN), mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.",
					"Since the small initial launch order for twenty 737-300s split between two airlines, over 5,000 Boeing 737 aircraft had been delivered with CFM56 turbofans by April 2010.",
					"In 1998, CFMI launched the \"Tech56\" development and demonstration program to create an engine for the new single-aisle aircraft that were expected to be built by Airbus and Boeing. The program focused on developing a large number of new technologies for the theoretical future engine, not necessarily creating an all-new design. When it became clear that Boeing and Airbus were not going to build all-new aircraft to replace the 737 and A320, CFMI decided to apply some of those Tech56 technologies to the CFM56 in the form of the \"Tech Insertion\" program which focused on three areas: fuel efficiency, maintenance costs and emissions. Launched in 2004, the package included redesigned high-pressure compressor blades, an improved combustor, and improved high- and low-pressure turbine components which resulted in better fuel efficiency and lower nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The new components also reduced engine wear, lowering maintenance costs by about 5%. The engines entered service in 2007, and all new CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B engines are being built with the Tech Insertion components. CFMI also offers the components as an upgrade kit for existing engines.",
					"In 2009, CFMI announced the latest upgrade to the CFM56 engine, the \"CFM56-7B Evolution\" or CFM56-7BE. This upgrade, announced with improvements to Boeing's 737 Next Generation, further enhances the high- and low-pressure turbines with better aerodynamics, as well as improving engine cooling, and aims to reduce overall part count. CFMI expected the changes to result in a 4% reduction in maintenance costs and a 1% improvement in fuel consumption (2% improvement including the airframe changes for the new 737); flight and ground tests completed in May 2010 revealed that the fuel burn improvement was better than expected at 1.6%. Following 450 hours of testing, the CFM56-7BE engine was certified by FAA and EASA on 30 July 2010 and delivered from mid-2011.",
					"The CFM56-5B/3 PIP (Performance Improvement Package) engine includes these new technologies and hardware changes to lower fuel burn and lower maintenance cost. Airbus A320s were to use this engine version starting in late 2011.",
					"The LEAP is a new engine design based on and designed to replace the CFM56 series, with 16% efficiency savings by using more composite materials and achieving higher bypass ratios of over 10:1. LEAP entered service in 2016.",
					"As of June 2016, the CFM56 is the most-used high-bypass turbofan. It has achieved more than 800 million engine flight hours, and at a rate of one million flight hours every eight days it is expected to have achieved one billion flight hours by 2020. It has more than 550 operators and more than 2,400 CFM56-powered jet aircraft are in the air at any given moment. It is known for its dependability: its average time on wing is 30,000 hours before a first shop visit, with the current fleet record at 50,000 hours.",
					"As of July 2016, 30,000 engines have been built: 9,860 CFM56-5 engines for the Airbus A320ceo and A340-200/300 and more than 17,300 CFM56-3/-7B engines for the Boeing 737 Classic and 737NG. In July 2016, CFM had 3,000 engines in backlog. Lufthansa, launch customer for the CFM56-5C-powered A340, have an engine with more than 100,000 flight hours, having entered commercial service on 16 November 1993, overhauled four times since. In 2016 CFM delivered 1,665 CFM56 and booked 876 orders, it plans to produce CFM56 spare parts until 2045.",
					"By October 2017, CFM had delivered more than 31,000 engines and 24,000 were in service with 560 operators, it attained 500 million flight cycles and 900 million flight hours, including over 170 million cycles and 300 million hours since 1998 for the B737NG's -7B and over 100 million cycles and 180 million hours for the A320ceo's -5B since 1996. By June 2018, 32,645 were delivered. Strong demand will extend production to 2020, up from 2019.",
					"Exhaust gas temperature margin erodes with usage. One or two performance restoration shop visits, costing $0.3-$0.6m for a -5 series, can be performed before taking the engine off wing, which can restore 60% to 80% of the original margin. Once restored, the life limited parts must be replaced after: 20,000 cycles for the hot section ($0.5m), 25,000 for the axial compressor, and 30,000 for the fan and booster ($0.5m-$0.7m) for a recent CFM56. The whole engine parts cost more than $3m, $3.5 to $4m with the shop work-hours, around $150 per cycle.",
					"By June 2019, the CFM56 fleet had surpassed one billion engine flight hours (nearly 115,000 years), having carried more than 35 billion people, over eight million times around the world.",
					"The CFM56 production will wind down as the final 737NG engine was delivered in 2019 and the last A320ceo engine will be delivered in May 2020. Production will continue at low levels for military 737s and spare engines and will conclude around 2024.",
					"Unit cost: US$10 million (list price)",
					"The CFM56 is a high-bypass turbofan engine (most of the air accelerated by the fan bypasses the core of the engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000 lbf (80 kN to 150 kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.",
					"Most variants of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is injected into the airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. This contrasts with a can combustor, where each combustion chamber is separate, and a cannular combustor which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine by means of an electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).",
					"In 1989, CFMI began work on a new, double-annular combustor. Instead of having just one combustion zone, the double-annular combustor has a second combustion zone that is used at high thrust levels. This design lowers the emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The first CFM56 engine with the double-annular combustor entered service in 1995, and the combustor is used on CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B variants with the suffix \"/2\" on their nameplates.",
					"GE started developing and testing a new type of combustor called the Twin Annular Premixing Swirler combustor, or \"TAPS\", during the Tech 56 program. This design is similar to the double-annular combustor in that it has two combustion zones; this combustor \"swirls\" the flow, creating an ideal fuel–air mixture. This difference allows the combustor to generate much less NOx than other combustors. Tests on a CFM56-7B engine demonstrated an improvement of 46% over single-annular combustors and 22% over double-annular combustors. The analytical tools developed for TAPS have also been used to improve other combustors, notably the single-annular combustors in some CFM56-5B and -7B engines.",
					"The high-pressure compressor (HPC), that was at the center of the original export controversy, features nine stages in all variants of the CFM56. The compressor stages have been developed from GE's \"GE1/9 core\" (namely a single-turbine, nine-compressor stage design) which was designed in a compact core rotor. The small span of the compressor radius meant that the entire engine could be lighter and smaller, as the accessory units in the system (bearings, oiling systems) could be merged to the main fueling system running on aviation fuel. As design evolved HPC design improved through better airfoil design. As part of the Tech-56 improvement program CFMI has tested the new CFM-56 model with six-stage high-pressure compressor stages (discs that make up the compressor system) that was designed to deliver same pressure ratios (pressure gain 30) similar to the old nine-stages compressor design. The new one was not fully replacing the old one, but it offered an upgrade in HPC, thanks to improved blade dynamics, as a part of their \"Tech Insertion\" management plan from 2007.",
					"CFMI tested both a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the beginning of development; most variants of the engine have an unmixed exhaust nozzle.[nb 2] Only the high-power CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow exhaust nozzle.[nb 1]",
					"GE and Snecma also tested the effectiveness of chevrons on reducing jet noise.[nb 3] After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.",
					"The CFM56 features a single-stage fan, and most variants have a three-stage booster on the low-pressure shaft,[nb 4] with four stages in the -5B and -5C variants. The booster is also commonly called the \"low-pressure compressor\" (LPC) as it is part of the low-pressure spool and continues the air compression done by the inner part of the fan before it reaches the high-pressure compressor. The original CFM56-2 variant featured 44 tip-shrouded fan blades,[nb 5] although the number of fan blades was reduced in later variants as wide-chord blade technology developed, down to 22 blades in the CFM56-7 variant.",
					"The CFM56 fan features dovetailed fan blades which allows them to be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/Snecma claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few fan blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.",
					"The fan diameter varies with the different models of the CFM56, and that change has a direct impact on the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).",
					"The CFM56 is designed to support several thrust reverser systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing 737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the thrust of the engine and slowing the aircraft down.",
					"The CFM56 also supports pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type is used on the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft such as the Airbus A320. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.",
					"All variants of the CFM56 feature a single-stage high-pressure turbine (HPT). In some variants, the HPT blades are \"grown\" from a single crystal superalloy, giving them high strength and creep resistance. The low-pressure turbine (LPT) features four stages in most variants of the engine, but the CFM56-5C has a five-stage LPT. This change was implemented to drive the larger fan on this variant. Improvements to the turbine section were examined during the Tech56 program, and one development was an aerodynamically optimized low-pressure turbine blade design, which would have used 20% fewer blades for the whole low-pressure turbine, saving weight. Some of those Tech56 improvements made their way into the Tech Insertion package, where the turbine section was updated. The turbine section was updated again in the \"Evolution\" upgrade.",
					"The high-pressure turbine stages in the CFM56 are internally cooled by air from the high-pressure compressor. The air passes through internal channels in each blade and ejects at the leading and trailing edges.",
					"The CFM56-2 series is the original variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it is known as the F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor driven by a single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is annular.",
					"The first derivative of the CFM56 series, the CFM56-3 was designed for Boeing 737 Classic series (737-300/-400/-500), with static thrust ratings from 18,500 to 23,500 lbf (82.3 to 105 kN). A \"cropped fan\" derivative of the -2, the -3 engine has a smaller fan diameter at 60 in (1.5 m) but retains the original basic engine layout. The new fan was primarily derived from GE's CF6-80 turbofan rather than the CFM56-2, and the booster was redesigned to match the new fan.",
					"A significant challenge for this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This was overcome by reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing 737 with CFM56 engines.",
					"The CFM56-4 series was a proposed improved version of the CFM56-2 designed for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Competing with the RJ500 engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, the -4 series was designed to produce 25,000 lbf (110 kN) and was to feature a new 68 in (1.73 m) fan, a new low-pressure compressor and a full authority digital engine controller (FADEC). Soon after the upgrade project was launched in 1984, International Aero Engines offered their new V2500 engine for the A320. CFMI realized that the CFM56-4 did not compare favorably with the new engine and scrapped the project to begin working on the CFM56-5 series.",
					"The CFM56-5 series is designed for the Airbus aircraft and has a very wide thrust rating of between 22,000 and 34,000 lbf (97.9 and 151 kN). It has three distinct sub-variants; the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B and CFM56-5C, and differs from its Boeing 737 Classic-fitted cousins by featuring a FADEC and incorporating further aerodynamic design improvements.",
					"The CFM56-5A series is the initial CFM56-5 series, designed to power the short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500 lbf (98 kN and 118 kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.",
					"An improvement of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000 lbf (98 kN and 147 kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.",
					"With a thrust rating of between 31,200 and 34,000 lbf (139 kN and 151 kN), the CFM56-5C series is the most powerful of the CFM56 family. It powers Airbus' long-range A340-200 and -300 airliners, and entered service in 1993. The major changes are a larger fan, a fifth low-pressure turbine stage, and the same four-stage low-pressure compressor found in the -5B variant.",
					"Unlike every other variant of the CFM56, the -5C features a mixed-exhaust nozzle,[nb 1] which offers slightly higher efficiency.",
					"The CFM56-7 first ran on 21 April 1995. Rated with a takeoff thrust range of 19,500–27,300 lbf (87–121 kN), it powers the -600/-700/-800/-900 Boeing 737 Next Generation; compared to the CFM56-3, it has greater durability, 8% fuel burn improvement and a 15% reduction in maintenance costs.",
					"Improvements are due to its 61-inch titanium wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new core and low-pressure turbine with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 36 (CFM56-5) to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5B such as a double-annular combustor as an option.",
					"Less than two years after entry into service, the Next-Generation 737 received 180 minutes Extended range twin engine Operations (ETOPS) certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It also powers the Boeing 737 military versions : Airborne Early Warning & Control, C-40 Clipper transport and P-8 Poseidon Maritime Aircraft.",
					"The CFM56 has an in-flight shutdown rate of 1 incident per 333,333 hours. Record time on wing before the first shop visit was 30,000 hours in 1996, to 40,729 hours in 2003 and 50,000 hours in 2016.",
					"There have been several engine failures in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of the engine to be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell's hydromechanical unit.",
					"There are several recorded incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning early in the CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite under these conditions.",
					"In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had to ditch in a river because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight attendant and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve the way in which the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.",
					"One issue that led to accidents with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.",
					"At the time it was not mandatory to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000 lbf (98 kN) from 23,500 lbf (105 kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.",
					"In August 2016 Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 suffered a fan blade failure, but landed later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.",
					"On 17 April 2018, Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 suffered from what appears to be a fan blade failure, debris from which punctured a window. The Boeing 737-700 landed safely, but one passenger was killed and several were injured.",
					"Airlines have reported 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, at various points during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation has led to the tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told Aviation Week and Space Technology that CFM International had revised its FADEC software. The new software \"...'reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events' by cycling the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo valve) to clean the EHSV spool.\" This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.",
					"According to Bloomberg, European aviation regulators have determined that London-based AOG Technics, majority owned by Jose Zamora Yrala, whose nationality is listed as British on some forms and Venezuelan on others, supplied parts of unknown origin and false documents for repairs on CFM56's."

It was a development of Pratt & Whitney's earlier R-1690 Hornet and was basically similar, but enlarged in capacity from 1,690 to 1,860 cubic inches (30.5 L). Cylinder bore was increased by 1/8\" and the crankshaft stroke by 3/8\". Both engines were air-cooled radial engines, with a single row of nine cylinders.",
					"The cylinder and valve design was typical for Pratt & Whitney, a simple design with two large valves driven by pushrods. The enlarged engine was designed by George Willgoos and was first available in 1929.",
					"The Hornet series of engines was similar to the Wasp, but larger. In both series a nine-cylinder single-row engine was later supplemented by an enlarged fourteen cylinder engine, with two rows of the same cylinders, but reduced in number to seven per row to aid cooling to the rear row (it was never made into a larger, 18 cylinder radial like the related Wasp was).",
					"Two of these engines, the enlarged single-row Hornet B described here and the R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp was by far the more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the mean piston speed is reduced, the distance the piston has to cover per each engine revolution being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57. This reduced drag, and the relatively large diameter of the Hornet would also have been a serious drawback for visibility if used in a small single-engined aircraft.",
					"Although a technically competent design, the enlarged Hornet B engine was not a commercial success. Customers preferred to buy the R-1830 Twin Wasp instead, which in time became the most numerous aircraft engine ever produced.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp is an American twin-row, 18-cylinder, air-cooled radial aircraft engine with a displacement of 2,800 cu in (46 L), and is part of the long-lived Wasp family of engines. ",
					"The R-2800 saw widespread use in many important American aircraft during and after World War II. During the war years, Pratt & Whitney continued to develop new ideas to upgrade the engine, including water injection for takeoff in cargo and passenger planes and to give emergency power in combat.",
					"First run in 1937, near the time that the larger 3,347.9 cu in (54.862 L) competing 18-cylinder Wright Duplex-Cyclone's development had been started in May of that year, the 2,804.5 cu in (45.958 L)  displacement R-2800 was first-flown by 1940, one year before the Duplex-Cyclone. The Double Wasp was more powerful than the world's only other modern 18-cylinder engine, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442 cu in (56.40 L).[nb 1] The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the cylinder-head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head in such a way that the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins.  The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward gear reduction housing - with one of the pair of magnetos mounted between them on most models - and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the \"outboard\" sides of the distributor casings.",
					"When the R-2800 was introduced in 1939, it was capable of producing 2,000 hp (1,500 kW), for a specific power value of 0.71 hp/cu in (32 kW/L). The design of conventional air-cooled radial engines had become so scientific and systematic by then that the Double Wasp was introduced with a smaller incremental power increase than was typical of earlier engines. Nevertheless, in 1941 the power output of production models increased to 2,100 hp (1,600 kW), and to 2,400 hp (1,800 kW) late in the war. Even more was coaxed from experimental models, with fan-cooled subtypes like the R-2800-57 producing 2,800 hp (2,100 kW), but in general the R-2800 was a rather highly developed powerplant right from the beginning.",
					"The R-2800 powered several types of fighters and medium bombers during the war, including the US Navy's Vought F4U Corsair, with the XF4U-1 first prototype Corsair becoming the first airframe to fly (as originally designed) with the Double Wasp in its XR-2800-4 prototype version on May 29, 1940, and the first single-engine American fighter plane to exceed 400 mph (640 km/h) in level flight during October 1940. The R-2800 also powered the Corsair's naval rival, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the US Army Air Forces' Republic P-47 Thunderbolt (which uniquely, for single-engined aircraft, used a General Electric turbocharger), the twin-engine Martin B-26 Marauder and Douglas A-26 Invader, as well as the first purpose-built twin-engine radar-equipped night fighter, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher octane rating (anti-knock value) to give considerably more power. By 1944, versions of the R-2800 powering late-model P-47s (and other aircraft) had a rating (experimental) of 2,800 hp (2,100 kW) on 115-grade fuel with water injection.",
					"After World War II, the engine was used in the Korean War, and surplus World War II aircraft powered by the Double Wasp served with other countries well past the Korean War, some being retired as late as the latter part of the 1960s when the aircraft were replaced.",
					"Engines grow in power with development, but a major war demands the utmost performance from engines fitted to aircraft whose life in front-line service was unlikely to exceed 50 hours flying, over a period of only a month or two. In peacetime however, the call was for reliability over a period of perhaps a dozen years, and the R-2800's reliability commended its use for long-range patrol aircraft and for the Douglas DC-6, Martin 4-0-4, and Convair 240 transports. The last two were twin-engine aircraft of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the DC-4 - itself usually powered by the R-2000 bored-out version of the Twin Wasp - and the first Constellations, which mostly used Wright Aeronautical's large Duplex-Cyclones.",
					"The Double Wasp still flies in restored vintage warbird aircraft displayed at air shows, and sees service worldwide on aircraft such as the Canadair CL-215 water-bomber. In addition, R-2800s continue to power Douglas DC-6 cargo and fuel-carrying aircraft in locations such as Alaska. A total of 125,334 R-2800 engines were produced between 1939 and 1960.",
					"This is a list of representative R-2800 variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Double Wasp. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum \"military\" power that the engine could generate on takeoff and at altitude; 100 Octane fuel was used, unless otherwise noted.",
					"The R-2800 was developed and modified into a basic sequence of subtypes, \"A\" through \"E\" series, each of which indicated major internal and external modifications and improvements, such that the \"E\" series engines had very few parts in common with the \"A\".[citation needed]. Pratt & Whitney's internal variant identification incorporated the series letter as part of the designation, for example Double Wasp S1A4-G (\"A\" series) and Double Wasp CB17 (\"C\" series).",
					"Data from White (Airlife) unless otherwise noted:",
					"The dash number for each military type (e.g.: -21) was allocated to identify the complete engine model in accordance with the specification under which the engine was manufactured. Thus dash numbers did not necessarily indicate the sequence in which the engines were manufactured. For example: the -18W was a \"C\" series engine, built from 1945, whereas the -21 was a \"B\" series engine, built from 1943.",
					"Until 1940 the armed forces adhered strictly to the convention that engines built for the Army Air Forces used engine model numbers with odd numeric suffixes (e.g.: -5), while those built for the US Navy used even (e.g.: -8). After 1940, however, in the interests of standardization, engines were sometimes built to a joint Army-Navy contract, in which case the engines used a common numeric suffix (e.g. the -10 was used by both Army and Navy aircraft.)",
					"The suffix W e.g.: -10W denotes a sub-series modified to use water injection. The \"Anti-Detonant Injection\" (ADI) system injected a mixture of water and methanol into the carburetor to increase power for short periods. Several models of the R-2800s were fitted with ADI as standard  equipment and were not given the W suffix.[nb 2] Few commercial aircraft used water injection.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II. First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family, and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology.",
					"The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets, but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56).",
					"Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone, first run some seven years earlier (May 1937).",
					"The R-4360 was a 28-cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \"corncob\" nickname. A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds.",
					"The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri. The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required.[citation needed]  Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest.  Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy.  Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era.",
					"Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW). Engines weighed 3,482–3,870 lb (1,579–1,755 kg), giving a power-to-weight ratio of 1.11 hp/lb (1.82 kW/kg).",
					"Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built.",
					"A derivative engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E, was essentially the R-4360 \"cut in half\". It had two rows of seven cylinders each, and was used on the postwar Saab 90 Scandia airliner."

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp is an American twin-row, 18-cylinder, air-cooled radial aircraft engine with a displacement of 2,800 cu in (46 L), and is part of the long-lived Wasp family of engines. ",
					"The R-2800 saw widespread use in many important American aircraft during and after World War II. During the war years, Pratt & Whitney continued to develop new ideas to upgrade the engine, including water injection for takeoff in cargo and passenger planes and to give emergency power in combat.",
					"First run in 1937, near the time that the larger 3,347.9 cu in (54.862 L) competing 18-cylinder Wright Duplex-Cyclone's development had been started in May of that year, the 2,804.5 cu in (45.958 L)  displacement R-2800 was first-flown by 1940, one year before the Duplex-Cyclone. The Double Wasp was more powerful than the world's only other modern 18-cylinder engine, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442 cu in (56.40 L).[nb 1] The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the cylinder-head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head in such a way that the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins.  The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward gear reduction housing - with one of the pair of magnetos mounted between them on most models - and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the \"outboard\" sides of the distributor casings.",
					"When the R-2800 was introduced in 1939, it was capable of producing 2,000 hp (1,500 kW), for a specific power value of 0.71 hp/cu in (32 kW/L). The design of conventional air-cooled radial engines had become so scientific and systematic by then that the Double Wasp was introduced with a smaller incremental power increase than was typical of earlier engines. Nevertheless, in 1941 the power output of production models increased to 2,100 hp (1,600 kW), and to 2,400 hp (1,800 kW) late in the war. Even more was coaxed from experimental models, with fan-cooled subtypes like the R-2800-57 producing 2,800 hp (2,100 kW), but in general the R-2800 was a rather highly developed powerplant right from the beginning.",
					"The R-2800 powered several types of fighters and medium bombers during the war, including the US Navy's Vought F4U Corsair, with the XF4U-1 first prototype Corsair becoming the first airframe to fly (as originally designed) with the Double Wasp in its XR-2800-4 prototype version on May 29, 1940, and the first single-engine American fighter plane to exceed 400 mph (640 km/h) in level flight during October 1940. The R-2800 also powered the Corsair's naval rival, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the US Army Air Forces' Republic P-47 Thunderbolt (which uniquely, for single-engined aircraft, used a General Electric turbocharger), the twin-engine Martin B-26 Marauder and Douglas A-26 Invader, as well as the first purpose-built twin-engine radar-equipped night fighter, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher octane rating (anti-knock value) to give considerably more power. By 1944, versions of the R-2800 powering late-model P-47s (and other aircraft) had a rating (experimental) of 2,800 hp (2,100 kW) on 115-grade fuel with water injection.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-1860 Hornet B was a relatively uncommon aircraft engine. It was a development of Pratt & Whitney's earlier R-1690 Hornet and was basically similar, but enlarged in capacity from 1,690 to 1,860 cubic inches (30.5 L). Cylinder bore was increased by 1/8\" and the crankshaft stroke by 3/8\". Both engines were air-cooled radial engines, with a single row of nine cylinders.",
					"The cylinder and valve design was typical for Pratt & Whitney, a simple design with two large valves driven by pushrods. The enlarged engine was designed by George Willgoos and was first available in 1929.",
					"The Hornet series of engines was similar to the Wasp, but larger. In both series a nine-cylinder single-row engine was later supplemented by an enlarged fourteen cylinder engine, with two rows of the same cylinders, but reduced in number to seven per row to aid cooling to the rear row (it was never made into a larger, 18 cylinder radial like the related Wasp was).",
					"Two of these engines, the enlarged single-row Hornet B described here and the R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp was by far the more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the mean piston speed is reduced, the distance the piston has to cover per each engine revolution being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57.

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior is a series of nine-cylinder, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines built by the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company from the 1930s to the 1950s. These engines have a displacement of 985 in3 (16 L); initial versions produced 300 hp (220 kW), while the most widely used versions produce 450 hp (340 kW).",
					"Wasp Juniors have powered numerous smaller civil and military aircraft, including small transports, utility aircraft, trainers, agricultural aircraft, and helicopters. Over 39,000 engines were built, and many are still in service today.",
					"Pratt & Whitney developed the R-985 Wasp Junior as a smaller version of the R-1340 Wasp to compete in the market for medium-sized aircraft engines. Like its larger brother, the Wasp Junior was an air-cooled, nine-cylinder radial, with its power boosted by a gear-driven single-speed centrifugal type supercharger. Its cylinders were smaller, however, with a bore and stroke of .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}5+3⁄16 in (132 mm), giving a 27% lesser total displacement. The Wasp Junior used many parts from the Wasp and even had the same mounting dimensions, allowing an aircraft to easily use either the smaller or the larger engine. The first run of the Wasp Junior was in 1929, and sales began in 1930. The initial version, the Wasp Junior A, produced 300 hp (224 kW).",
					"The U.S. military designated the Wasp Junior as the R-985, with various suffixes denoting different military engine models. However, Pratt & Whitney never adopted the R-985 designation scheme for its civilian Wasp Juniors, identifying them simply by name and model (e.g. \"Wasp Junior A\").",
					"Pratt & Whitney followed the Wasp Junior A with more powerful models in the \"A series\". These had higher compression ratios, greater RPM limits, and more effective supercharging, and they led to the \"B series\". The first B series model was the Wasp Junior TB, which could maintain 420 hp (310 kW) at sea level and could reach 440 hp (330 kW) for takeoff. The TB was tuned for best performance at sea level; it was soon joined by the Wasp Junior SB, which was tuned for best performance at altitude and could sustain 400 hp (300 kW) at altitudes up to 5,000 ft (1,500 m), with 450 hp (340 kW) available for takeoff.  A still later model, the Wasp Junior T1B2, had improved performance at low level, being able to sustain 450 hp (340 kW) up to 1,500 ft (460 m) while still matching the SB's power at high altitudes. The SB and T1B2, and later versions of these with similar performance, were the most popular Wasp Junior models. One later development of the T1B2, the Wasp Junior B4, was especially designed for vertical mounting in helicopters.",
					"During the mid-1930s, Pratt & Whitney developed a still greater improvement of the Wasp Junior, the \"C series\", with an even higher compression ratio and RPM limit. The only type produced in this series, the Wasp Junior SC-G, could sustain 525 hp (391 kW) at an altitude of 9,500 ft (2,900 m) and could produce 600 hp (450 kW) for takeoff. It also included reduction gearing to allow the high-revving engine to drive a propeller at suitable speeds, hence the \"-G\" suffix. Aviator Jacqueline Cochran flew a special Model D-17W Beechcraft Staggerwing with this engine in 1937, setting a speed and altitude record and placing third in the Bendix transcontinental race. However, the SC-G never got past the experimental stage.",
					"Early versions of the Wasp Junior were used in various small civilian and military utility aircraft, but only in limited numbers.  The type became more popular later in the 1930s. It was selected for the Lockheed Model 10A Electra twin-engined airliner, as well as for other small twin-engined civil transports like the Lockheed Model 12A Electra Junior, the Beechcraft Model 18, and the Grumman Goose amphibious aircraft. It was also used in single-engined civilian utility aircraft like the Beechcraft Staggerwing, the Howard DGA-15, and the Spartan Executive.",
					"As World War II arrived, the U.S. military chose the Wasp Junior for the Vultee BT-13 Valiant and North American BT-14 basic training aircraft and for the Vought OS2U Kingfisher observation floatplane. Military versions of existing Wasp Junior-powered civilian aircraft were also produced, such as the military derivatives of the Beech 18, Beech Staggerwing, Grumman Goose, and Howard DGA-15. The Wasp Junior also powered some versions of the British Avro Anson and Airspeed Oxford twin-engined trainers. The demands of World War II led to the production of many thousands of Wasp Juniors.",
					"Until the end of the war, the Wasp Junior's closest competitor was Wright Aeronautical's R-975 Whirlwind. However, during the war, the Wasp Junior was far more widely used in aircraft than the R-975, and Wright ceased production of the R-975 in 1945.",
					"After World War II, many military-surplus aircraft with Wasp Junior engines entered the civilian market. New designs based on the Wasp Junior were also introduced, such as the Sikorsky H-5 helicopter, the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, and Max Holste Broussard bush airplanes, and agricultural aircraft such as the Snow S-2B and S-2C, Grumman Ag Cat, and Weatherley 201.",
					"Pratt & Whitney ceased production of the Wasp Junior in 1953, having built 39,037 engines. Many Wasp Junior engines are still in use today in older bush planes and agricultural planes, as well as in antique aircraft. Some antique aircraft, such as the Boeing-Stearman Model 75, which originally used other engines, have had them replaced with the Wasp Junior to provide more power or for easier maintenance, since parts for the Wasp Junior are readily available.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II. First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family, and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology.",
					"The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets, but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56).",
					"Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone, first run some seven years earlier (May 1937).",
					"The R-4360 was a 28-cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \"corncob\" nickname. A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds.",
					"The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri. The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required.[citation needed]  Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest.  Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy.  Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era.",
					"Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW).

					"The X-1800 was a watercooled 24-cylinder H-block of 2,240 in3 displacement; this was later expanded to 2,600 in3 displacement. It was intended to be used in the Vultee XP-54, Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender, Northrop XP-56, Lockheed XP-49, and Lockheed XP-58 Chain Lightning. Projected performance was to be 1,800 to 2,200 hp (1350-1640 kW), with a turbocharger to secure high-altitude performance. The designation came from the intended power rating rather than the more usual cubic inch engine displacement figure.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney J57 (company designation: JT3C) is an axial-flow turbojet engine developed by Pratt & Whitney in the early 1950s. The J57 (first run January 1950) was the first 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust class engine in the United States. The J57/JT3C was developed into the J52 turbojet, the J75/JT4A turbojet, the JT3D/TF33 turbofan, and the XT57 turboprop (of which only one was built). The J57 and JT3C saw extensive use on fighter jets, jetliners, and bombers for many decades.",
					"The J57 was a development of the Pratt & Whitney XT45 (PT4) turboprop engine that was originally intended for the Boeing XB-52. As the B-52 power requirements grew, the design evolved into a turbojet, the JT3.",
					"Pratt & Whitney designed the J57 to have a relatively high overall pressure ratio to help improve both Thrust-specific fuel consumption and specific thrust, but it was known that throttling a single high pressure ratio compressor would cause stability problems. As Sir Stanley Hooker explains in his autobiography, the outlet area of a compressor is significantly smaller than that of its inlet, which is fine when operating at the design pressure ratio, but during starting and at low throttle settings the compressor pressure ratio is low so ideally the outlet area should be much larger than its design value. Put crudely the air taken in at the front cannot get out the back, which causes the blades at the front of the compressor to stall and vibrate. The compressor surges, which normally means the airflow reverses direction, causing a sharp drop in thrust.",
					"By the late 1940s, three potential solutions to the stability problem had been identified:",
					"1) bleeding any excess compressed air at part speed overboard through interstage blow-off valves",
					"2) incorporating variable geometry in the first few stages of the compressor",
					"3) splitting the compressor into two units, one of which supercharges the other, with both units being mounted on separate shafts and driven by their own turbine",
					"GE adopted the second option with their General Electric J79, while Pratt & Whitney adopted the two-spool arrangement with their J57.",
					"P&W realized that if they could develop a modest pressure ratio (< 4.5:1) axial compressor to handle adequately at any throttle setting including starting and acceleration, they could put two such compressors in series to achieve a higher overall pressure ratio.",
					"In a two-spool arrangement, the first compressor, usually called Low Pressure Compressor (LPC), is driven by the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), and supercharges another unit known as the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) itself driven by the High Pressure Turbine (HPT). During starting the HP spool starts to rotate first, while the LP spool is stationary. As the HP spool accelerates and the fuel:air mixture in the combustor lights up, at some point there is sufficient energy in the turbine gas stream to start to rotate the LP spool, which accelerates, albeit more sluggishly. Eventually, at full throttle, both spools will rotate at their design speeds. Because the exit temperature of the HPC is obviously higher than that of the LPC, a similar blade tip Mach number for both units is achieved by making the design HP shaft speed significantly higher than that of the LP shaft. Any reductions in compressor diameter going towards the combustor exaggerates the difference.",
					"In the same timeframe as the J57, the Bristol Aeroplane Company Engine Division in the UK also adopted the two-spool arrangement into their Olympus turbojet engine series, which went on to propel the Avro Vulcan bomber and later the Concorde. Within a few months, both P&W and Bristol had had a first run of their prototypes. Both demonstrated superb handling.",
					"Today, most civil and military turbofans have a two spool configuration, a notable exception being the Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan series which has three spools.",
					"Incidentally, most modern civil turbofans use all three of the above options to handle the extremely high overall pressure ratios employed today (50:1 typically).",
					"During the 1950s the J57 was an extremely popular engine, with numerous military applications. Production figures were in the thousands, which led to a very reliable engine. Consequently, it was only natural for Boeing to choose the J57 civil variant, the JT3C, for their 707 jetliner. Douglas did likewise with their DC-8. Pressure to reduce jet noise and specific fuel consumption later resulted in P&W using an innovative modification to convert the JT3C turbojet into the JT3D two spool turbofan, initially for civil purposes, but also for military applications like the Boeing B-52H. The prestigious Collier Trophy for 1952 was awarded to Leonard S. Hobbs, Chief Engineer of United Aircraft Corporation, for \"designing and producing the P&W J57 turbojet engine\". The engine was produced from 1951 to 1965 with a total of 21,170 built.",
					"Many J57 models shipped since 1954 contained 7-15% of titanium, by dry weight. Commercially pure titanium was used in the inlet case and low pressure compressor case, whereas the low pressure rotor assembly was made up of 6Al-4V titanium alloy blades, discs and disc spacers. ",
					"Titanium alloys used in the J57 in the mid-50s suffered hydrogen embrittlement: 412  until the problem was understood.",
					"On May 25, 1953, a J57-powered YF-100A exceeded Mach 1 on its first flight.",

					"The Rolls-Royce RB.41 Nene is a 1940s British centrifugal compressor turbojet engine. The Nene was a complete redesign, rather than a scaled-up Rolls-Royce Derwent, with a design target of 5,000 lbf (22 kN), making it the most powerful engine of its era. First run in 1944, it was Rolls-Royce's third jet engine to enter production, and first ran less than 6 months from the start of design. It was named after the River Nene in keeping with the company's tradition of naming its jet engines after rivers.",
					"The design saw relatively little use in British aircraft designs, being passed over in favour of the axial-flow Avon that followed it. Its only widespread use in the UK was in the Hawker Sea Hawk and the Supermarine Attacker. In the US it was built under licence as the Pratt & Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther. Its most widespread use was in the form of the Klimov VK-1, a reverse-engineered, modified and enlarged version which produced around 6,000 lbf (27 kN) of thrust, and powered the Russian built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, a highly successful fighter aircraft which was produced in vast numbers.",
					"An uprated version of the Nene was produced as the Rolls-Royce Tay.",
					"The Nene was designed as a result of a June 1944 visit to the US by Hooker. He discovered that General Electric already had two engine types running, an axial and a centrifugal, of 4,000 lbf (18 kN) thrust. He was determined to produce a higher thrust engine and subsequently obtained a Ministry of Aircraft Production contract for an engine of 4,200 lbf (19 kN) thrust with the understanding that 5,000 lbf (22 kN) would be the design target. Hooker, Lombard, Pearson and Morley designed a new engine, the B.41 later called the Nene, rather than scaling up the Derwent. ",
					"The double-sided impeller was 28.8 inches (73 cm) in diameter, compared to 20.68 in (52.5 cm) for the Derwent I, to produce an airflow of 80 lb/s (36 kg/s), while the overall diameter of the engine was 49.5 inches (126 cm). A scaled up Derwent of the same thrust would have had a 60-inch (150 cm) diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, an attempt was made to start the engine. To the frustration of everyone with a vested interest in it starting the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On a subsequent attempt, Denis Drew, who had come from Lucas, the combustion specialists, and took a wide interest in engine development problems, removed one of the igniters and instead used the flame from an oxy-acetylene torch to ignite the fuel in the combustion chamber.",
					"The igniter had to be close enough to the fuel spray to ignite it when starting, but not overheat when subjected to the continuous flame temperature when the engine was running. The larger diameter of the Nene combustion chambers found this to be a problem,  and the first-run needed to ignite with a flame rather than the spark energy that was considered sufficient at that time. The Nene was subsequently fitted with two torch, or flame, igniters which had a fuel spray next to an igniter. The flame would project into the main combuster fuel spray. Torch igniters were superseded by surface discharge igniter plugs with a considerably greater energy release rate than a flame.",
					"The engine was run up to just over 4,000 lbf (18 kN), and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. However the engine was running hotter than expected and would not reach 5,000 lb, as it was built, without overheating the turbine. Pearson, the performance engineer, insisted that no more running be done without fitting the guide vanes that were available for the impeller intake. Upon Hooker's arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was overjoyed to see the thrust gauge needle registering 5,000 lbf (22 kN) at the same temperature that had only given 4,000 lb the previous night, making the B.41 the highest thrust jet engine in the world. Weight was around 1,600 lb (730 kg).",
					"Inlet guide vanes had been in use in Whittle engines for some time. They improve the overall performance of the engine significantly by \"helping the air round the corner\". However they were made from thin sheet metal and often broke damaging the engine. For Hooker they were a worrying mechanical problem which he did not want so they were not fitted when the Derwent entered service, although the turbine had to run 90 degC hotter to give the take-off thrust of 2,000 lb. He was still concerned with the durability of the vanes so the first Nene was initially built without them.",
					"The Nene was based on the \"straight-through\" version of the basic Whittle-style layout, with the flow going directly through the engine from front to rear, as opposed to a \"reverse-flow\" type, which reverses the direction of air flow through the combustor section so that the turbine stage can be mounted within the combustor section; this allows for a more compact engine, but increases the combustor pressure losses which has an adverse effect on engine performance. Less thrust is generated with the same fuel flow. It was during the design of the Nene that Rolls decided to give their engines numbers as well as names, with the Welland and Derwent keeping their original Rover models, B/23 and B/26. It was later decided that these model designations looked too much like RAF bomber designations (i.e. \"English Electric Canberra B.Mk 2\" would often be shortened to \"Canberra B.2\"), and \"R\" was added to the front, the \"R\" signifying \"Rolls\" and the original Rover \"B\" signifying Barnoldswick. This RB designation scheme continued into the late 20th Century, with turbofan designs such as the RB.199, RB.203 and RB.211; the most recent family of Rolls-Royce turbofans (a development of the RB.211) goes under the simple designation \"Rolls-Royce Trent\", with variants given their own designator number or letter series (i.e. Trent 500, Trent 900, Trent 1000, Trent XWB, etc.).",
					"Early airborne tests of the Nene were undertaken in an Avro Lancastrian operated by Rolls-Royce from their Hucknall airfield. The two outboard Rolls-Royce Merlins were replaced by the jet engine. The Nene's first flight however was in a modified Lockheed XP-80 Shooting Star.",
					"After seeing the Nene running, at an after work drink at the Swan & Royal Hotel, Clitheroe, and hearing the complaints about a lack of any official application for the engine, someone - thought to be Whittle - suggested that the Nene be scaled-down to fit a Meteor nacelle. J.P. Herriot or Lombard did the calculation on a tablecloth and announced a thrust of 3,650 lbf (16.2 kN). At this time they were attempting to increase the Derwent's thrust from 2,200 to 2,450 lbf (9.8 to 10.9 kN), and the idea seemed \"too good to be true\". On hearing this, Hooker did a quick calculation and announced, \"We've got a 600-mph [970 km/h] Meteor\".",
					"Drawings for the 0.855 scale Nene, now known as the Derwent V, were started on 1 January 1945 and on 7 June the engine began a 100-hour test at 2,600 lbf (12 kN), soon reaching 3,500 lbf (16 kN). Weight was 1,250 lb (570 kg). By 1946 thrust had been increased to 4,200 lbf (19 kN) using Nimonic 90 turbine blades.",
					"The development of the Nene was continued with this scaled-down version, the Derwent V having no direct relationship to the earlier Derwent series. On 7 November 1945, the first official air speed record by a jet aircraft was set by a Meteor F.3 of 606 miles per hour (975 km/h) powered by the scaled-down Nene.",
					"The Nene doubled the thrust of the earlier generation engines, with early versions providing about 5,000 lbf (22.2 kN), but remained generally similar in most ways. This should have suggested that it would be widely used in various designs, but the Gloster Meteor proved so successful with its Derwents that the Air Ministry felt there was no pressing need to improve upon it. Instead a series of much more capable designs using the Rolls-Royce Avon were studied, and the Nene generally languished.",
					"A total of twenty-five Nenes were sold to the Soviet Union as a gesture of goodwill - with reservation to not use for military purposes - with the agreement of Stafford Cripps. Rolls-Royce were given permission in September 1946 to sell 10 Nene engines to the USSR, and in March 1947 to sell a further 15. The price was fixed under a commercial contract. A total of 55 jet engines were sold to the Soviets in 1947. The Soviets reneged on the deal after the Cold War broke out in 1947, and reverse engineered the Nene to develop the Klimov RD-45, and a larger version, the Klimov VK-1, which soon appeared in various Soviet fighters including Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.",
					"Pratt & Whitney acquired a licence to produce the Nene as the Pratt & Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther which first flew in November 1947.",
					"The Nene was used to power the first civil jet aircraft, the Nene Viking, a modified Vickers Viking, the single example of which first flew on 6 April 1948 from Wisley Airfield.[page needed]",
					"It was briefly made under licence in Australia for use in the RAAF de Havilland Vampire fighters. It was also built by Orenda in Canada for use in 656 Canadair CT-133 Silver Star aircraft from 1952.",
					"Hispano-Suiza in France built the Nene under licence as the Hispano-Suiza Nene, with limited production before concentrating on the larger Rolls-Royce Tay/Hispano-Suiza Verdon."

					"The Pratt & Whitney J75 (civilian designation: JT4A) is an axial-flow turbojet engine first flown in 1955. A two-spool design in the 17,000 lbf (76 kN) thrust class, the J75 was essentially the bigger brother of the Pratt & Whitney J57 (JT3C). It was known in civilian service as the JT4A, and in a variety of stationary roles as the GG4 and FT4.",
					"In military use, the J75 was used on the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Lockheed U-2, and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. It was also utilized in the prototype and experimental Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, Lockheed A-12, Martin P6M SeaMaster, North American YF-107, and Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III.",
					"Before the arrival of the Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan engine, the JT4A was used to power certain Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 models, bringing improved field performance in the medium-range Boeing 707-220 and Douglas DC-8-20, and intercontinental range in the Boeing 707-320 and the Douglas DC-8-30.  By late 1959, P&W had considered introducing a turbofan version of the J75, which was to have tentatively been named the TF75 or JT4D. Apparently, little interest was shown by the aircraft industry, so the variant was dropped.[citation needed]",
					"After its relatively short lifetime in the aircraft role, the JT4A found more enduring use in the naval role, where the FT4 was produced in a variety of models between 18,000 and 22,000 hp (13 and 16 MW). Well-known uses include the first all-turbine warships, the Canadian Iroquois-class destroyers, as well as the United States Coast Guard's Hamilton-class cutters, the 1970s-built icebreakers Polar Sea and Polar Star (each 3 engines in CODOG configuration), and it was considered for the US Navy's Asheville-class gunboat. The same basic powerplant saw much wider use as a peak demand power turbine running on natural gas. From its introduction in 1960 over 1,000 FT4s have been sold, with many of them still in operation for electrical generation. Outdated by modern standards, refits are available that add catalytic converters to lower their emissions.",

It was initially intended to power the A4D-3 Skyhawk, an advanced avionics model that was canceled in 1957. After being canceled, the U.S. Air Force selected the J52 to power the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. The engine was designed with several unique features for this application, including a \"conical centerbody mounted in the intake\" and a \"variable central plug ... in the nozzle\". Then, in 1958, the US Navy selected the engine to power what became the A-6 Intruder.",

This helped heavily laden B-52s fly away from their airbases faster, which would have been useful in case of nuclear attacks on the bases. The Hound Dog could then be refueled from the B-52's wing fuel tanks."

					"The Pratt & Whitney J58 (company designation JT11D-20) is an American jet engine that powered the Lockheed A-12, and subsequently the YF-12 and the SR-71 aircraft. It was an afterburning turbojet engine with a unique compressor bleed to the afterburner that gave increased thrust at high speeds. Because of the wide speed range of the aircraft, the engine needed two modes of operation to take it from stationary on the ground to 2,000 mph (3,200 km/h) at altitude. It was a conventional afterburning turbojet for take-off and acceleration to Mach 2 and then used permanent compressor bleed to the afterburner above Mach 2. The way the engine worked at cruise led it to be described as \"acting like a turboramjet\". It has also been described as a turboramjet based on incorrect statements describing the turbomachinery as being completely bypassed.",
					"The engine performance that met the mission requirements for the CIA and USAF over many years was later enhanced slightly for NASA experimental work (carrying external payloads on the top of the aircraft), which required more thrust to deal with higher aircraft drag.",
					"The J58, company designation JT11, had its origins in the larger JT9 (J91) engine. It was a 3/4 scale JT9 with a mass flow of 300 lb/s (140 kg/s), down from 400 lb/s (180 kg/s). The JT11 was proposed to the US Navy under their designation J58. It was also proposed for various Navy and Air Force aircraft, e.g. Convair F-106, North American F-108, Convair B-58C, Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III, and North American A3J Vigilante, but none of these applications followed.",
					"The J58 began development for the US Navy to power the planned Martin P6M jet flying boat. The P6M started out using Allison J71-A-4 engines and then switched to the Pratt & Whitney J75, due to J58 development delays. Upon cancellation of the P6M, it was selected for the Convair Kingfish and for the Lockheed A-12, YF-12A and SR-71. Other sources link its origin to the USAF's requirement for a powerplant for the WS-110A, the future XB-70 Valkyrie.",
					"Analytical calculations of the performance of the original J58 showed 3 problems at Mach 2.5: \"exhaust pressure was equal to the inlet pressure, the compressor was deep in surge, and there was no cool air to the afterburner liner that would therefore melt\".",
					"The first problem was caused by too-high a compressor delivery temperature, which did not allow enough energy to be added in the engine combustor to provide any thrust from the gas generator. All the thrust-producing pressure in the jet-pipe came from ram, as with a ramjet, and none from the gas generator. Fuel for thrust could only be added in the afterburner, which became the only source of engine thrust. The speed at which the gas generator produced no thrust was raised from about Mach 2.5 to about Mach 3 by patented design changes. Beyond that speed, the gas generator would become a drag item with, at Mach 3.2, a pressure ratio of 0.9. Even minimum afterburner would not balance the drag. The effect was described qualitatively by Lockheed inlet designer David Campbell \"..with minimum afterburner the engine would be dragging on the engine mounts at high Mach numbers.\"",
					"The second problem (the compressor deep in surge) was caused by the compressor trying to operate at too-low a corrected speed in an area of its compressor map known as \"off-design\". The third problem was caused by the afterburner duct being cooled with too-hot turbine exhaust gas.",
					"U.S. Patent 3,344,606 describes the changes to the engine that extended the engine's capability to Mach 3.2. They included diverting 20% of the compressor entry air after the 4th compressor stage directly to the afterburner through six external tubes. This allowed the compressor to work properly with adequate surge margin and increased airflow into the compressor. Some of the increased flow left the compressor after the 4th stage as bypass to the afterburner, and some left the last compressor stage through the previously choked area. The increased airflow gave more thrust. The inlet guide vanes were modified with trailing-edge flaps to reduce blade flutter and prevent blade fatigue failures. The afterburner was cooled by the bleed air that was 400 °F (220 °C) cooler than the turbine exhaust gas. Not all the oxygen in the bleed air was available for combustion, as most of the bleed air was directed into the cooling shroud before entering the afterburner cavity for reheating. The improved afterburner cooling allowed a higher flame temperature, which gave more thrust.",
					"The engine was completely redesigned, except for the compressor and turbine aerodynamic definitions, so that it would be reliable running for prolonged periods at unprecedented temperatures, not only inside the engine but also surrounding the casings where the controls, accessories, electrical wiring and fuel and oil tubes were located.",
					"Two starting methods were used during the life of the A-12, YF-12 and SR-71 aircraft: an AG330 starter cart with two Buick V8 engines driving a common output shaft, or compressed air driving a small starter adapter. The air-start method superseded the cumbersome \"Buicks\" when better compressed air supplies became available.",
					"Any aircraft flying at three times the speed of sound is in a severe thermal environment, both from frictional heating and stagnation ram rise. The fuel was the only heat sink available to the aircraft and after absorbing 40,000 Btu/min (700 kW), keeping everything cool enough from the crew to the exhaust nozzle area indicator, it was supplied to the fuel nozzles at 600 °F (316 °C). To cope with these high temperatures, a new jet fuel with a low vapor pressure had to be developed. A chemical method for igniting the fuel, triethyl borane (TEB), was developed to match its low volatility. TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air above −5 °C. The engine and afterburner were lit with TEB and the afterburner also had a catalytic igniter that glowed in the hot turbine exhaust.  Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with 600 cm3 (21.1 imp fl oz; 20.3 US fl oz) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number was one of the limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.8 imp fl oz; 1.7 US fl oz) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.",
					"One heat source required two-stage reduction. Before entering the fuel heat-sink system, the Environmental Control System (ECS) air leaving the engine compressor at 1,230 °F (666 °C) was so hot that ram air at 760 °F (404 °C) had to be used first. Fuel flowing from the tanks to the engines was used to cool the air conditioning systems, aircraft hydraulic fluid, engine oil, accessory drive system oil, the TEB tank and afterburner nozzle actuator control lines.",
					"The development of the J58 involved some of the most challenging metallurgical development problems experienced by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft so far, with components operating at unprecedented temperatures and levels of stress and durability. New manufacturing techniques as well as new alloys improved the mechanical properties, and surface coatings had to be developed to protect components.",
					"Premature cracking of turbine vanes and blades made from conventionally cast (i.e. equiaxed) Mar-M200, the strongest cast nickel-base alloy, was avoided by the development of directionally solidified parts cast in the same material. Directionally solidified Mar-M200 became the strongest cast turbine material to date and was introduced in production engines. Single-crystal turbine blades cast in Mar-M200, giving further improvement of high temperature resistance, would also be developed through testing in J58 engines. Waspaloy was the most widely used alloy in the engine, from critical high-energy rotating compressor discs to components made from sheet. Although used for turbine discs in other engines, it did not have the required properties for J58 turbine discs. Astroloy, the strongest known nickel-base superalloy in the Western world at that time, was used instead. Waspaloy was also used initially for the diffuser case, the part that joins the compressor to the combustor and that contains the highest pressure in the engine. Diffuser case weld cracking led to the introduction of Inconel 718 for this part. The afterburner liner was sprayed with ceramic thermal barrier coating that, together with the cooling air from the compressor, allowed continuous use of the afterburner with flame temperatures up to 3,200 °F (1,760 °C).",
					"NASA was loaned 2 SR-71 aircraft for research work. One was modified to flight-test a Linear Aerospike rocket engine and was fitted with thrust-enhanced J58 engines. Engine thrust was increased by 5% to offset increased aircraft drag. The increased thrust came from a throttle push, or exhaust gas temperature uptrim, of 75 °F (42 °C). The increase was limited by the allowable reduction in life of the second-stage turbine blades (the life-limiting component) from 400 to 50 hours. The same thrust-enhancement studies used for this work also looked at an additional 5% thrust from additional afterburner fuel made possible with oxidizer injection (nitrous oxide). The nitrous oxide rate would have been limited by thermal choking of the nozzle.",
					"As of 2021[update], the J58 is the only known aircraft engine designed to operate continuously at maximum afterburning at high Mach number cruise. J58 experience was used extensively in the JTF17 engine proposal for a Mach 2.7 SST, due to significant flight time at Mach 2.7 and above. It was also used for subsequent engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, both commercial and military. The next afterburning engine, the TF30 as installed in the F-111, used an airframe-mounted secondary nozzle with free-floating flaps similar to that used on the SR-71.",
					"J58 emissions were measured as part of the NASA Stratospheric Wake Experiment, which looked at the environmental impact of using afterburning jet engines for supersonic transports. An engine was tested in an altitude chamber at a maximum condition of full afterburning at Mach 3.0 and 19.8 km altitude.",
					"Alternative solutions to combat the adverse effects of high inlet temperature on the aerodynamic performance of the compressor were rejected by the Pratt & Whitney patentee, Robert Abernethy. One of those solutions was used in a contemporary installation. The GE YJ93/XB-70 used a variable-stator compressor to avoid front-stage stall and rear-stage choking.",
					"Another possible solution, pre-compressor cooling, was used on the MiG-25. Water/methanol was injected from a spray mast in front of the compressor to lower the intake temperature for short durations at maximum speed. Pre-compressor cooling was also proposed for a Mach 3 reconnaissance Phantom and the Mach 3+ F-106 RASCAL project.",
					"The propulsion system consisted of the intake, engine, nacelle or secondary airflow and ejector nozzle (propelling nozzle). The propulsive thrust distribution between these components changed with flight speed: at Mach 2.2 inlet 13% – engine 73% – ejector 14%; at Mach 3.0+ inlet 54% – engine 17.6% – ejector 28.4%.",
					"The intake had to supply air to the engine with acceptable pressure loss and distortion. It had to do this in all flight conditions.",
					"The ejector, or secondary, nozzle performed the reverse function of the inlet accelerating the turbine exhaust from about Mach 1.0, as it left the primary nozzle, back up to Mach 3. Mach 3 exhaust velocity is higher than Mach 3 flight velocity due to the much-higher temperature in the exhaust. The nacelle airflow from the intake controlled the expansion of the hot engine exhaust in the ejector nozzle. This air flowed around the engine and served also to cool the hot external parts of the engine and to purge any combustible mixtures in the event of a fuel or oil leak in the nacelle.",

First run in 1944, it was Rolls-Royce's third jet engine to enter production, and first ran less than 6 months from the start of design.

Its most widespread use was in the form of the Klimov VK-1, a reverse-engineered, modified and enlarged version which produced around 6,000 lbf (27 kN) of thrust, and powered the Russian built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, a highly successful fighter aircraft which was produced in vast numbers.",

					"The double-sided impeller was 28.8 inches (73 cm) in diameter, compared to 20.68 in (52.5 cm) for the Derwent I, to produce an airflow of 80 lb/s (36 kg/s), while the overall diameter of the engine was 49.5 inches (126 cm). A scaled up Derwent of the same thrust would have had a 60-inch (150 cm) diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, an attempt was made to start the engine. To the frustration of everyone with a vested interest in it starting the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On a subsequent attempt, Denis Drew, who had come from Lucas, the combustion specialists, and took a wide interest in engine development problems, removed one of the igniters and instead used the flame from an oxy-acetylene torch to ignite the fuel in the combustion chamber.",
					"The igniter had to be close enough to the fuel spray to ignite it when starting, but not overheat when subjected to the continuous flame temperature when the engine was running. The larger diameter of the Nene combustion chambers found this to be a problem,  and the first-run needed to ignite with a flame rather than the spark energy that was considered sufficient at that time. The Nene was subsequently fitted with two torch, or flame, igniters which had a fuel spray next to an igniter. The flame would project into the main combuster fuel spray. Torch igniters were superseded by surface discharge igniter plugs with a considerably greater energy release rate than a flame.",
					"The engine was run up to just over 4,000 lbf (18 kN), and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. However the engine was running hotter than expected and would not reach 5,000 lb, as it was built, without overheating the turbine. Pearson, the performance engineer, insisted that no more running be done without fitting the guide vanes that were available for the impeller intake. Upon Hooker's arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was overjoyed to see the thrust gauge needle registering 5,000 lbf (22 kN) at the same temperature that had only given 4,000 lb the previous night, making the B.41 the highest thrust jet engine in the world. Weight was around 1,600 lb (730 kg).",
					"Inlet guide vanes had been in use in Whittle engines for some time. They improve the overall performance of the engine significantly by \"helping the air round the corner\". However they were made from thin sheet metal and often broke damaging the engine. For Hooker they were a worrying mechanical problem which he did not want so they were not fitted when the Derwent entered service, although the turbine had to run 90 degC hotter to give the take-off thrust of 2,000 lb. He was still concerned with the durability of the vanes so the first Nene was initially built without them.",
					"The Nene was based on the \"straight-through\" version of the basic Whittle-style layout, with the flow going directly through the engine from front to rear, as opposed to a \"reverse-flow\" type, which reverses the direction of air flow through the combustor section so that the turbine stage can be mounted within the combustor section; this allows for a more compact engine, but increases the combustor pressure losses which has an adverse effect on engine performance. Less thrust is generated with the same fuel flow. It was during the design of the Nene that Rolls decided to give their engines numbers as well as names, with the Welland and Derwent keeping their original Rover models, B/23 and B/26. It was later decided that these model designations looked too much like RAF bomber designations (i.e. \"English Electric Canberra B.Mk 2\" would often be shortened to \"Canberra B.2\"), and \"R\" was added to the front, the \"R\" signifying \"Rolls\" and the original Rover \"B\" signifying Barnoldswick. This RB designation scheme continued into the late 20th Century, with turbofan designs such as the RB.199, RB.203 and RB.211; the most recent family of Rolls-Royce turbofans (a development of the RB.211) goes under the simple designation \"Rolls-Royce Trent\", with variants given their own designator number or letter series (i.e. Trent 500, Trent 900, Trent 1000, Trent XWB, etc.).",
					"Early airborne tests of the Nene were undertaken in an Avro Lancastrian operated by Rolls-Royce from their Hucknall airfield. The two outboard Rolls-Royce Merlins were replaced by the jet engine. The Nene's first flight however was in a modified Lockheed XP-80 Shooting Star.",
					"After seeing the Nene running, at an after work drink at the Swan & Royal Hotel, Clitheroe, and hearing the complaints about a lack of any official application for the engine, someone - thought to be Whittle - suggested that the Nene be scaled-down to fit a Meteor nacelle. J.P. Herriot or Lombard did the calculation on a tablecloth and announced a thrust of 3,650 lbf (16.2 kN). At this time they were attempting to increase the Derwent's thrust from 2,200 to 2,450 lbf (9.8 to 10.9 kN), and the idea seemed \"too good to be true\". On hearing this, Hooker did a quick calculation and announced, \"We've got a 600-mph [970 km/h] Meteor\".",
					"Drawings for the 0.855 scale Nene, now known as the Derwent V, were started on 1 January 1945 and on 7 June the engine began a 100-hour test at 2,600 lbf (12 kN), soon reaching 3,500 lbf (16 kN). Weight was 1,250 lb (570 kg). By 1946 thrust had been increased to 4,200 lbf (19 kN) using Nimonic 90 turbine blades.",
					"The development of the Nene was continued with this scaled-down version, the Derwent V having no direct relationship to the earlier Derwent series. On 7 November 1945, the first official air speed record by a jet aircraft was set by a Meteor F.3 of 606 miles per hour (975 km/h) powered by the scaled-down Nene.",
					"The Nene doubled the thrust of the earlier generation engines, with early versions providing about 5,000 lbf (22.2 kN), but remained generally similar in most ways. This should have suggested that it would be widely used in various designs, but the Gloster Meteor proved so successful with its Derwents that the Air Ministry felt there was no pressing need to improve upon it. Instead a series of much more capable designs using the Rolls-Royce Avon were studied, and the Nene generally languished.",
					"A total of twenty-five Nenes were sold to the Soviet Union as a gesture of goodwill - with reservation to not use for military purposes - with the agreement of Stafford Cripps. Rolls-Royce were given permission in September 1946 to sell 10 Nene engines to the USSR, and in March 1947 to sell a further 15. The price was fixed under a commercial contract. A total of 55 jet engines were sold to the Soviets in 1947. The Soviets reneged on the deal after the Cold War broke out in 1947, and reverse engineered the Nene to develop the Klimov RD-45, and a larger version, the Klimov VK-1, which soon appeared in various Soviet fighters including Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.",
					"Pratt & Whitney acquired a licence to produce the Nene as the Pratt & Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther which first flew in November 1947.",
					"The Nene was used to power the first civil jet aircraft, the Nene Viking, a modified Vickers Viking, the single example of which first flew on 6 April 1948 from Wisley Airfield.[page needed]",
					"It was briefly made under licence in Australia for use in the RAAF de Havilland Vampire fighters. It was also built by Orenda in Canada for use in 656 Canadair CT-133 Silver Star aircraft from 1952.",
					"Hispano-Suiza in France built the Nene under licence as the Hispano-Suiza Nene, with limited production before concentrating on the larger Rolls-Royce Tay/Hispano-Suiza Verdon."

It powered the A-6 Intruder and the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. As of 2021[update] the engine was still in use in models of the A-4 Skyhawk.",
					"The engine is the basis for the Pratt & Whitney JT8D, a popular civilian low-bypass turbofan engine.",
					"The J52 was developed in the mid-1950s for the US Navy as a scaled-down derivative of the J57/JT3A. It was initially intended to power the A4D-3 Skyhawk, an advanced avionics model that was canceled in 1957. After being canceled, the U.S. Air Force selected the J52 to power the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. The engine was designed with several unique features for this application, including a \"conical centerbody mounted in the intake\" and a \"variable central plug ... in the nozzle\". Then, in 1958, the US Navy selected the engine to power what became the A-6 Intruder.",
					"The J52-P-6 model, designed for the YA2F-1 (YA-6A) Intruder, had a unique nozzle that could be angled downward at 23 degrees for STOL takeoffs; this was not used on production A-6s. Returning full circle, the J52 was selected to power the A4D-5, another model of the A-4 Skyhawk, remaining in all subsequent new-built models.",
					"The twin-spool J52 employs a split 12-stage axial compressor consisting of a five-stage low pressure unit and a seven-stage high pressure unit. Behind the compressor is a nine-unit can-annular combustion chamber and a two-stage split turbine.",
					"In 1960, U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) developed procedures so that the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could use the Hound Dog's J52 engine for additional thrust while the missile was located on the bomber's two pylons. This helped heavily laden B-52s fly away from their airbases faster, which would have been useful in case of nuclear attacks on the bases. The Hound Dog could then be refueled from the B-52's wing fuel tanks."

					"The Pratt & Whitney J57 (company designation: JT3C) is an axial-flow turbojet engine developed by Pratt & Whitney in the early 1950s. The J57 (first run January 1950) was the first 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust class engine in the United States. The J57/JT3C was developed into the J52 turbojet, the J75/JT4A turbojet, the JT3D/TF33 turbofan, and the XT57 turboprop (of which only one was built). The J57 and JT3C saw extensive use on fighter jets, jetliners, and bombers for many decades.",
					"The J57 was a development of the Pratt & Whitney XT45 (PT4) turboprop engine that was originally intended for the Boeing XB-52. As the B-52 power requirements grew, the design evolved into a turbojet, the JT3.",
					"Pratt & Whitney designed the J57 to have a relatively high overall pressure ratio to help improve both Thrust-specific fuel consumption and specific thrust, but it was known that throttling a single high pressure ratio compressor would cause stability problems. As Sir Stanley Hooker explains in his autobiography, the outlet area of a compressor is significantly smaller than that of its inlet, which is fine when operating at the design pressure ratio, but during starting and at low throttle settings the compressor pressure ratio is low so ideally the outlet area should be much larger than its design value. Put crudely the air taken in at the front cannot get out the back, which causes the blades at the front of the compressor to stall and vibrate. The compressor surges, which normally means the airflow reverses direction, causing a sharp drop in thrust.",
					"By the late 1940s, three potential solutions to the stability problem had been identified:",
					"1) bleeding any excess compressed air at part speed overboard through interstage blow-off valves",
					"2) incorporating variable geometry in the first few stages of the compressor",
					"3) splitting the compressor into two units, one of which supercharges the other, with both units being mounted on separate shafts and driven by their own turbine",
					"GE adopted the second option with their General Electric J79, while Pratt & Whitney adopted the two-spool arrangement with their J57.",
					"P&W realized that if they could develop a modest pressure ratio (< 4.5:1) axial compressor to handle adequately at any throttle setting including starting and acceleration, they could put two such compressors in series to achieve a higher overall pressure ratio.",
					"In a two-spool arrangement, the first compressor, usually called Low Pressure Compressor (LPC), is driven by the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), and supercharges another unit known as the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) itself driven by the High Pressure Turbine (HPT). During starting the HP spool starts to rotate first, while the LP spool is stationary. As the HP spool accelerates and the fuel:air mixture in the combustor lights up, at some point there is sufficient energy in the turbine gas stream to start to rotate the LP spool, which accelerates, albeit more sluggishly. Eventually, at full throttle, both spools will rotate at their design speeds. Because the exit temperature of the HPC is obviously higher than that of the LPC, a similar blade tip Mach number for both units is achieved by making the design HP shaft speed significantly higher than that of the LP shaft. Any reductions in compressor diameter going towards the combustor exaggerates the difference.",
					"In the same timeframe as the J57, the Bristol Aeroplane Company Engine Division in the UK also adopted the two-spool arrangement into their Olympus turbojet engine series, which went on to propel the Avro Vulcan bomber and later the Concorde. Within a few months, both P&W and Bristol had had a first run of their prototypes. Both demonstrated superb handling.",
					"Today, most civil and military turbofans have a two spool configuration, a notable exception being the Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan series which has three spools.",
					"Incidentally, most modern civil turbofans use all three of the above options to handle the extremely high overall pressure ratios employed today (50:1 typically).",
					"During the 1950s the J57 was an extremely popular engine, with numerous military applications. Production figures were in the thousands, which led to a very reliable engine. Consequently, it was only natural for Boeing to choose the J57 civil variant, the JT3C, for their 707 jetliner. Douglas did likewise with their DC-8. Pressure to reduce jet noise and specific fuel consumption later resulted in P&W using an innovative modification to convert the JT3C turbojet into the JT3D two spool turbofan, initially for civil purposes, but also for military applications like the Boeing B-52H. The prestigious Collier Trophy for 1952 was awarded to Leonard S. Hobbs, Chief Engineer of United Aircraft Corporation, for \"designing and producing the P&W J57 turbojet engine\". The engine was produced from 1951 to 1965 with a total of 21,170 built.",
					"Many J57 models shipped since 1954 contained 7-15% of titanium, by dry weight. Commercially pure titanium was used in the inlet case and low pressure compressor case, whereas the low pressure rotor assembly was made up of 6Al-4V titanium alloy blades, discs and disc spacers. ",
					"Titanium alloys used in the J57 in the mid-50s suffered hydrogen embrittlement: 412  until the problem was understood.",
					"On May 25, 1953, a J57-powered YF-100A exceeded Mach 1 on its first flight.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney J58 (company designation JT11D-20) is an American jet engine that powered the Lockheed A-12, and subsequently the YF-12 and the SR-71 aircraft. It was an afterburning turbojet engine with a unique compressor bleed to the afterburner that gave increased thrust at high speeds. Because of the wide speed range of the aircraft, the engine needed two modes of operation to take it from stationary on the ground to 2,000 mph (3,200 km/h) at altitude. It was a conventional afterburning turbojet for take-off and acceleration to Mach 2 and then used permanent compressor bleed to the afterburner above Mach 2. The way the engine worked at cruise led it to be described as \"acting like a turboramjet\". It has also been described as a turboramjet based on incorrect statements describing the turbomachinery as being completely bypassed.",
					"The engine performance that met the mission requirements for the CIA and USAF over many years was later enhanced slightly for NASA experimental work (carrying external payloads on the top of the aircraft), which required more thrust to deal with higher aircraft drag.",
					"The J58, company designation JT11, had its origins in the larger JT9 (J91) engine. It was a 3/4 scale JT9 with a mass flow of 300 lb/s (140 kg/s), down from 400 lb/s (180 kg/s). The JT11 was proposed to the US Navy under their designation J58. It was also proposed for various Navy and Air Force aircraft, e.g. Convair F-106, North American F-108, Convair B-58C, Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III, and North American A3J Vigilante, but none of these applications followed.",
					"The J58 began development for the US Navy to power the planned Martin P6M jet flying boat. The P6M started out using Allison J71-A-4 engines and then switched to the Pratt & Whitney J75, due to J58 development delays. Upon cancellation of the P6M, it was selected for the Convair Kingfish and for the Lockheed A-12, YF-12A and SR-71. Other sources link its origin to the USAF's requirement for a powerplant for the WS-110A, the future XB-70 Valkyrie.",
					"Analytical calculations of the performance of the original J58 showed 3 problems at Mach 2.5: \"exhaust pressure was equal to the inlet pressure, the compressor was deep in surge, and there was no cool air to the afterburner liner that would therefore melt\".",
					"The first problem was caused by too-high a compressor delivery temperature, which did not allow enough energy to be added in the engine combustor to provide any thrust from the gas generator. All the thrust-producing pressure in the jet-pipe came from ram, as with a ramjet, and none from the gas generator. Fuel for thrust could only be added in the afterburner, which became the only source of engine thrust. The speed at which the gas generator produced no thrust was raised from about Mach 2.5 to about Mach 3 by patented design changes. Beyond that speed, the gas generator would become a drag item with, at Mach 3.2, a pressure ratio of 0.9. Even minimum afterburner would not balance the drag. The effect was described qualitatively by Lockheed inlet designer David Campbell \"..with minimum afterburner the engine would be dragging on the engine mounts at high Mach numbers.\"",
					"The second problem (the compressor deep in surge) was caused by the compressor trying to operate at too-low a corrected speed in an area of its compressor map known as \"off-design\". The third problem was caused by the afterburner duct being cooled with too-hot turbine exhaust gas.",
					"U.S. Patent 3,344,606 describes the changes to the engine that extended the engine's capability to Mach 3.2. They included diverting 20% of the compressor entry air after the 4th compressor stage directly to the afterburner through six external tubes. This allowed the compressor to work properly with adequate surge margin and increased airflow into the compressor. Some of the increased flow left the compressor after the 4th stage as bypass to the afterburner, and some left the last compressor stage through the previously choked area. The increased airflow gave more thrust. The inlet guide vanes were modified with trailing-edge flaps to reduce blade flutter and prevent blade fatigue failures. The afterburner was cooled by the bleed air that was 400 °F (220 °C) cooler than the turbine exhaust gas. Not all the oxygen in the bleed air was available for combustion, as most of the bleed air was directed into the cooling shroud before entering the afterburner cavity for reheating. The improved afterburner cooling allowed a higher flame temperature, which gave more thrust.",
					"The engine was completely redesigned, except for the compressor and turbine aerodynamic definitions, so that it would be reliable running for prolonged periods at unprecedented temperatures, not only inside the engine but also surrounding the casings where the controls, accessories, electrical wiring and fuel and oil tubes were located.",
					"Two starting methods were used during the life of the A-12, YF-12 and SR-71 aircraft: an AG330 starter cart with two Buick V8 engines driving a common output shaft, or compressed air driving a small starter adapter. The air-start method superseded the cumbersome \"Buicks\" when better compressed air supplies became available.",
					"Any aircraft flying at three times the speed of sound is in a severe thermal environment, both from frictional heating and stagnation ram rise. The fuel was the only heat sink available to the aircraft and after absorbing 40,000 Btu/min (700 kW), keeping everything cool enough from the crew to the exhaust nozzle area indicator, it was supplied to the fuel nozzles at 600 °F (316 °C). To cope with these high temperatures, a new jet fuel with a low vapor pressure had to be developed. A chemical method for igniting the fuel, triethyl borane (TEB), was developed to match its low volatility. TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air above −5 °C. The engine and afterburner were lit with TEB and the afterburner also had a catalytic igniter that glowed in the hot turbine exhaust.  Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with 600 cm3 (21.1 imp fl oz; 20.3 US fl oz) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number was one of the limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.8 imp fl oz; 1.7 US fl oz) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.",
					"One heat source required two-stage reduction. Before entering the fuel heat-sink system, the Environmental Control System (ECS) air leaving the engine compressor at 1,230 °F (666 °C) was so hot that ram air at 760 °F (404 °C) had to be used first. Fuel flowing from the tanks to the engines was used to cool the air conditioning systems, aircraft hydraulic fluid, engine oil, accessory drive system oil, the TEB tank and afterburner nozzle actuator control lines.",
					"The development of the J58 involved some of the most challenging metallurgical development problems experienced by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft so far, with components operating at unprecedented temperatures and levels of stress and durability. New manufacturing techniques as well as new alloys improved the mechanical properties, and surface coatings had to be developed to protect components.",
					"Premature cracking of turbine vanes and blades made from conventionally cast (i.e. equiaxed) Mar-M200, the strongest cast nickel-base alloy, was avoided by the development of directionally solidified parts cast in the same material. Directionally solidified Mar-M200 became the strongest cast turbine material to date and was introduced in production engines. Single-crystal turbine blades cast in Mar-M200, giving further improvement of high temperature resistance, would also be developed through testing in J58 engines. Waspaloy was the most widely used alloy in the engine, from critical high-energy rotating compressor discs to components made from sheet. Although used for turbine discs in other engines, it did not have the required properties for J58 turbine discs. Astroloy, the strongest known nickel-base superalloy in the Western world at that time, was used instead. Waspaloy was also used initially for the diffuser case, the part that joins the compressor to the combustor and that contains the highest pressure in the engine. Diffuser case weld cracking led to the introduction of Inconel 718 for this part. The afterburner liner was sprayed with ceramic thermal barrier coating that, together with the cooling air from the compressor, allowed continuous use of the afterburner with flame temperatures up to 3,200 °F (1,760 °C).",
					"NASA was loaned 2 SR-71 aircraft for research work. One was modified to flight-test a Linear Aerospike rocket engine and was fitted with thrust-enhanced J58 engines. Engine thrust was increased by 5% to offset increased aircraft drag. The increased thrust came from a throttle push, or exhaust gas temperature uptrim, of 75 °F (42 °C). The increase was limited by the allowable reduction in life of the second-stage turbine blades (the life-limiting component) from 400 to 50 hours. The same thrust-enhancement studies used for this work also looked at an additional 5% thrust from additional afterburner fuel made possible with oxidizer injection (nitrous oxide). The nitrous oxide rate would have been limited by thermal choking of the nozzle.",
					"As of 2021[update], the J58 is the only known aircraft engine designed to operate continuously at maximum afterburning at high Mach number cruise. J58 experience was used extensively in the JTF17 engine proposal for a Mach 2.7 SST, due to significant flight time at Mach 2.7 and above. It was also used for subsequent engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, both commercial and military. The next afterburning engine, the TF30 as installed in the F-111, used an airframe-mounted secondary nozzle with free-floating flaps similar to that used on the SR-71.",
					"J58 emissions were measured as part of the NASA Stratospheric Wake Experiment, which looked at the environmental impact of using afterburning jet engines for supersonic transports. An engine was tested in an altitude chamber at a maximum condition of full afterburning at Mach 3.0 and 19.8 km altitude.",
					"Alternative solutions to combat the adverse effects of high inlet temperature on the aerodynamic performance of the compressor were rejected by the Pratt & Whitney patentee, Robert Abernethy. One of those solutions was used in a contemporary installation. The GE YJ93/XB-70 used a variable-stator compressor to avoid front-stage stall and rear-stage choking.",
					"Another possible solution, pre-compressor cooling, was used on the MiG-25. Water/methanol was injected from a spray mast in front of the compressor to lower the intake temperature for short durations at maximum speed. Pre-compressor cooling was also proposed for a Mach 3 reconnaissance Phantom and the Mach 3+ F-106 RASCAL project.",
					"The propulsion system consisted of the intake, engine, nacelle or secondary airflow and ejector nozzle (propelling nozzle). The propulsive thrust distribution between these components changed with flight speed: at Mach 2.2 inlet 13% – engine 73% – ejector 14%; at Mach 3.0+ inlet 54% – engine 17.6% – ejector 28.4%.",
					"The intake had to supply air to the engine with acceptable pressure loss and distortion. It had to do this in all flight conditions.",
					"The ejector, or secondary, nozzle performed the reverse function of the inlet accelerating the turbine exhaust from about Mach 1.0, as it left the primary nozzle, back up to Mach 3. Mach 3 exhaust velocity is higher than Mach 3 flight velocity due to the much-higher temperature in the exhaust. The nacelle airflow from the intake controlled the expansion of the hot engine exhaust in the ejector nozzle. This air flowed around the engine and served also to cool the hot external parts of the engine and to purge any combustible mixtures in the event of a fuel or oil leak in the nacelle.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney J75 (civilian designation: JT4A) is an axial-flow turbojet engine first flown in 1955. A two-spool design in the 17,000 lbf (76 kN) thrust class, the J75 was essentially the bigger brother of the Pratt & Whitney J57 (JT3C). It was known in civilian service as the JT4A, and in a variety of stationary roles as the GG4 and FT4.",
					"In military use, the J75 was used on the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Lockheed U-2, and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. It was also utilized in the prototype and experimental Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, Lockheed A-12, Martin P6M SeaMaster, North American YF-107, and Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III.",
					"Before the arrival of the Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan engine, the JT4A was used to power certain Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 models, bringing improved field performance in the medium-range Boeing 707-220 and Douglas DC-8-20, and intercontinental range in the Boeing 707-320 and the Douglas DC-8-30.  By late 1959, P&W had considered introducing a turbofan version of the J75, which was to have tentatively been named the TF75 or JT4D. Apparently, little interest was shown by the aircraft industry, so the variant was dropped.[citation needed]",
					"After its relatively short lifetime in the aircraft role, the JT4A found more enduring use in the naval role, where the FT4 was produced in a variety of models between 18,000 and 22,000 hp (13 and 16 MW). Well-known uses include the first all-turbine warships, the Canadian Iroquois-class destroyers, as well as the United States Coast Guard's Hamilton-class cutters, the 1970s-built icebreakers Polar Sea and Polar Star (each 3 engines in CODOG configuration), and it was considered for the US Navy's Asheville-class gunboat. The same basic powerplant saw much wider use as a peak demand power turbine running on natural gas. From its introduction in 1960 over 1,000 FT4s have been sold, with many of them still in operation for electrical generation. Outdated by modern standards, refits are available that add catalytic converters to lower their emissions.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney JT3D is an early turbofan aircraft engine derived from the Pratt & Whitney JT3C.  It was first run in 1958 and was first flown in 1959 under a B-45 Tornado test aircraft. Over 8,000 JT3Ds were produced between 1959 and 1985. Most JT3D engines still in service today are used on military aircraft, where the engine is referred to by its US military designation of TF33.",
					"Aware of the competition from the Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan, Pratt & Whitney decided to develop the JT3D turbofan from the JT3C turbojet for later deliveries of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, then nearing entry into service. A 2-stage fan replaced the first 3 stages of the 9-stage JT3C LP compressor. On the LP turbine, the second stage was enlarged and a third stage added.",
					"Unlike GE with the CJ805-23, Pratt & Whitney had not undertaken any transonic fan research prior to designing the JT3D, so they were unable to incorporate a single stage unit into the specification. Instead P&W designed a 2-stage unit based on some research they had done to support the J91 nuclear turbojet.",
					"On the Boeing 707 the JT3D fan nacelle was relatively short, whereas the Douglas DC-8 installation had a full-length fan cowl. Pratt & Whitney provided a kit whereby JT3Cs could be converted to the JT3D specification, and performance, during an overhaul.",
					"In 1959, important orders for the engine were the Boeing 707-120B and Boeing 720B when American Airlines ordered one 707 powered by JT3D turbofans and KLM ordered a JT3D-powered Douglas DC-8. Earlier 707s and DC-8s had been powered by the JT3C and JT4A turbojets, and the improved efficiency of the turbofan soon attracted the airlines. A JT3D-powered 707-123B and 720-023B (the suffix B was to indicate a turbofan-powered aircraft) entered service with American Airlines on the same day, March 12, 1961.",
					"The Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers were all originally powered by turbojet engines. With the demise of many airline 707s, the United States Air Force took the opportunity to buy the surplus airframes and use the engines to re-fit the KC-135As used by the Air National Guard and reserve squadrons with the civilian JT3D (designated TF33-PW-102). Over 150 aircraft were modified and the former KC-135A was re-designated the KC-135E.",
					"After long service for both airlines and air forces, the number of JT3D-powered aircraft is steadily decreasing. One hundred thirty five KC-135s use the JT3D, while 354 were fitted with CFM International CFM56 engines, which provide greater thrust, lower fuel consumption, and increased operational flexibility due to their lower noise footprint. The noise of the JT3D is one of the reasons NATO has debated re-fitting their E-3 Sentry AWACS fleet, since the aircraft are subject to restrictions that aircraft with modern engines are not. Operational flexibility would be further increased due to the ability of higher power engines to increase the ceiling of the aircraft, extending the horizon for radar surveillance; for instance, RAF, French and Saudi E-3s routinely fly higher than NATO/USAF counterparts.",
					"In 1961, the TF33-powered Boeing B-52H Stratofortress entered service. The \"H\" model of the B-52 was the only production variant of the heavy bomber to be fitted with turbofan engines, and is the only model remaining in United States Air Force service. It is expected to remain as a mainstay of the Air Force heavy bomber fleet until at least 2040, with options for replacing the 8 TF33 engines with more modern equivalents being considered. In April 2020, the USAF released a request for proposals for 608 commercial replacement engines, with the plan to award the contract in May 2021. In September 2021, the USAF announced that the TF33 would be replaced by the Rolls-Royce F130.",

The JT9D-3, the earliest certified version of the engine, weighed 8,470 lb (3,840 kg) and produced 43,500 lbf (193 kN) thrust.",
					"Pratt & Whitney faced difficulties with the JT9D design during the Boeing 747 test program. Engine failures during the flight test program resulted in thirty aircraft being parked outside the factory with concrete blocks hanging from the pylons, awaiting redesigned engines.Boeing and Pratt & Whitney worked together in 1969 to solve the problem. The trouble was traced to ovalization, in which stresses during takeoff caused the engine casing to deform into an oval shape resulting in rubbing of high-pressure turbine blade tips. This was solved by strengthening the engine casing and adding yoke-shaped thrust links.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney JT8D is a low-bypass (0.96 to 1) turbofan engine introduced by Pratt & Whitney in February 1963 with the inaugural flight of the Boeing 727. It was a modification of the Pratt & Whitney J52 turbojet engine which powered the US Navy A-6 Intruder and A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft. Eight models comprise the JT8D standard engine family, covering the thrust range from 12,250 to 17,400 pounds-force (54 to 77 kN), and power the 727, 737-100/200, and DC-9. The updated JT8D-200 family, covering the 18,900 to 21,000 pounds-force (84 to 93 kN), powers the MD-80 and re-engined Super 27 aircraft. The JT8D was built under license in Sweden as the Volvo RM8, a redesigned afterburning derivative for the Saab 37 Viggen fighter. Pratt & Whitney also sells static versions for powerplant and ship propulsion as the FT8.",
					"The JT8D is an axial-flow front turbofan engine incorporating a two-spool design. There are two coaxially-mounted independent rotating assemblies: one rotating assembly for the low pressure compressor (LPC) which consists of the first six stages (i.e. six pairs of rotating and stator blades, including the first two stages which are for the bypass turbofan), driven by the second (downstream) turbine (which consists of three stages); and a second rotating assembly for the high-pressure compressor (HPC) section, which has seven stages.  The high-pressure compressor is driven by the first (upstream) turbine, which has a single stage.",
					"The front-mounted bypass fan has two stages. The annular discharge duct for the bypass fan runs along the full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle.  This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine exhaust is shrouded in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air.  Thus, the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced.",
					"Within the fan inlet case, there are anti-icing air bosses and probes to sense the inlet pressure and temperature.  Similar units exist throughout the engine to check temperatures and pressures.",
					"At the 13th (i.e. the final) compressor stage, air is bled out and used for anti-icing.  The amount is controlled by the Pressure Ratio Bleed Control sense signal (PRBC).  The diffuser case at the aft end of the compressor houses the 13th stage.  Its increasing cross-sectional area allows the compressed air to slow down before entering one of the engine's nine burner cans.  Again, there are two bosses to extract 13th stage air for anti-icing, de-icing of fuel, and airframe (cabin pressurization) use.  Not all the compressed air enters the burner cans at the fuel-ignition point; some bypasses the can completely and cools the first turbine stage, and some is gradually introduced into the burner can's perimeter in such a way that the burning fuel is held near the can's centerline.",
					"There are nine combustion chambers positioned in a can-annular arrangement. Each chamber has three air inlet hole sizes: the smallest is for cooling, the medium is for burning and the largest for forming an air blanket.",
					"20 in (510 mm) diameter rotor and bypass stator",
					"In response to environmental concerns that began in the 1970s, the company began developing a new version of the engine, the JT8D-200 series.  Designed to be quieter, cleaner, more efficient, yet more powerful than earlier models, the -200 Series power-plant was re-engineered with a significantly higher bypass ratio (1.74 to 1) covering the 18,500 to 21,700 pound-force (82 to 97 kN) thrust range and powering the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series.  This increase was achieved by increasing bypass fan diameter from 39.9 inches (101 cm) to 49.2 inches (125 cm) and reducing fan pressure ratio (from 2.21 to 1.92).[citation needed]  Overall engine pressure ratio was also increased from 15.4 to 21.0. Since entering service in 1980, more than 2,900 of the -200 series engines have been produced.",
					"The JT8D-217 and -219 engine(s) were tested in 2001 and were deemed suitable replacements for the old TF33 engines on military and commercial aircraft as part of the Super 27 re-engining program.  The updated engines offer reduced (Stage-3) noise compliance standards without the need for hush kits, enhanced short field performance, and steeper and faster climb rates with roughly a 10% reduction in fuel burn for extended range.",
					"Pratt & Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, has developed the JT8D-219 as a re-engine powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft. Northrop Grumman used the -219 to re-engine one of the United States Air Force's fleet of 19 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8 Joint STARS) aircraft, which would allow the JSTARS more time on station due to the engine's 17%  greater fuel efficiency. NATO plans to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing 707 re-engine powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, for reasons of geometrical and balance similarity to the engine it is replacing and the associated relative up-front wing modification costs of the two choices.",
					"The proposed Aerion SBJ supersonic business jet, previously under development, was to use a pair of JT8D-219 engines for sustained supersonic flight.",
					"More than 14,000 JT8D engines have been produced, totaling more than one-half billion hours of service, with more than 350 operators, making it the most popular of all low-bypass turbofan engines ever produced.  Regular production ended in 1985, but some replacement engines were produced for military aircraft in 2011. Mainline airline use of the JT8D continued until 2020 when Delta Air Lines retired their MD-88 fleet early due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

					"The Pratt & Whitney TF30 (company designation JTF10A) is a military low-bypass turbofan engine originally designed by Pratt & Whitney for the subsonic F6D Missileer fleet defense fighter, but this project was cancelled. It was later adapted with an afterburner for supersonic designs, and in this form it was the world's first production afterburning turbofan, going on to power the F-111 and the F-14A Tomcat, as well as being used in early versions of the A-7 Corsair II without an afterburner. First flight of the TF30 was in 1964 and production continued until 1986.",
					"In 1958, the Douglas Aircraft Company proposed a short-range, four-engined jet airliner to fill the gap below its new DC-8 intercontinental, known internally as the Model 2067. Intended to be marketed as  DC-9, it was not directly related to the later twin-engined Douglas DC-9. Pratt & Whitney (P&W) had offered its JT8A turbojet for the airliner, but Douglas preferred to go with a turbofan engine, which would have a greater fuel efficiency than a turbojet. P&W then proposed the JT10A, a half-scale version of its newly developed JT8D turbofan. Development of the new design began in April 1959, using the core of the JT8. Douglas shelved the model 2067 design in 1960, as the targeted US airlines preferred the newly offered Boeing 727.",
					"In 1960, the United States Navy selected the JT10A, designated TF30-P-1, to power the proposed Douglas F6D Missileer, but the project was canceled in April 1961. Meanwhile, the TF30 had been chosen by General Dynamics for its entrant in the TFX competition for the United States Air Force and USN, which was selected for production as the F-111. The version of the TF30 for the F-111 included an afterburner.",
					"The F-111A, EF-111A and F-111E used the TF30-P-3 turbofan. The F-111 had problems with inlet compatibility, and many faulted the placement of the intakes behind the disturbed air of the wing.  Newer F-111 variants incorporated improved intake designs and most variants featured more powerful versions of the TF30 engine.  The F-111E was updated to use TF30-P-103 engines, the F-111D included the TF30-P-9/109, the FB-111A used the TF-30-P-7/107, and the F-111F had the TF30-P-100. ",
					"RAAF F-111Cs were upgraded with the unique P-108 version, using a P-109 engine mated to a P-107 afterburner. The F-111 Engine Business Unit (later taken over by TAE) at RAAF Base Amberley became the world experts on the TF-30 in the years after the USAF retired their fleet and achieved extraordinary increases reliability of the TF-30. ",
					"The TF30 proved itself to be well-suited to the requirements of a high-speed low-altitude strike aircraft with a relatively long operational range, and F-111s in all guises would continue to use TF30s until their retirement.",
					"In 1964, the subsonic LTV A-7A Corsair II won the US Navy's VAL competition for a light attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. The A-7A used a non-afterburning variant of the TF30, which would also power the improved A-7B and A-7C.  In 1965, the USAF selected the A-7D as a replacement for its fast-jet F-100 and F-105 supersonic fighter-bombers in the close air support role. Though the USAF had wanted the TF30, Pratt & Whitney was unable to meet the production timetable, because its facilities were already committed to producing other engines. Instead of producing the TF30 under license for P&W, the Allison Engine Company offered to the Air Force its TF41 turbofan, a license-built version of the RB.168-25R Spey.  The USAF selected the more powerful TF41 for the A-7D, as did the USN, for its similar A-7E.",
					"The Grumman F-14 Tomcat with the TF30-P-414A was underpowered, because it was the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of 1 or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon).  However, due to the intent to incorporate as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant.  The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however, the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA), if the pilot moved the throttles aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.",
					"The F-14's problems did not afflict TF30 engines in the USAF and RAAF F-111s to nearly the same extent. The F-111, while technically designated as a \"fighter,\" was actually used as a ground attack aircraft and tactical bomber. A typical ground strike mission is characterized by less abrupt changes in throttle, angle of attack and altitude than an air-to-air combat mission. While it can still involve hard and violent maneuvers to avoid enemy missiles and aircraft, these maneuvers are generally still not nearly as hard and violent as those required in air-to-air combat, and the F-111 is a larger and less-maneuverable aircraft. Though the F-14A entered service with the Navy powered by the Pratt & Whitney TF30, by the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine, the Department of Defense began procuring F110-GE-400 engines and installed them in the F-14A Plus (later redesignated to F-14B in 1991), which entered service with the fleet in 1988. These engines solved the reliability problems and provided nearly 30% more thrust, achieving a 1:1 dry thrust to weight ratio with a low fuel load.  The subsequent F-14D, a combination of both remanufactured/upgraded F-14As and new manufacture F-14Ds, also used F110-GE-400 engines.",

Built by Pratt & Whitney, they were designed for the Boeing 757. As a 757 powerplant, these engines compete with the Rolls-Royce RB211.",
					"Pratt & Whitney began working on the JT10D in October 1971 intended for the McDonnell Douglas YC-15 into the Advanced Medium STOL Transport project and the Boeing 767, then code named 7X7, which first ran in August 1974.  In December 1980, Pratt & Whitney changed to a new naming system for its engines and the JT10D became the PW2037.",

The powerplant first flew on the C-17 in 1991. Still maintaining the F117 engine for the U.S. military, Pratt & Whitney received a $5.5 billion contract modification in June 2023 for engine sustainment in San Francisco, California; Columbus, Georgia; and Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, through September 2027.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW1120 turbofan is a derivative of the F100 turbofan. It was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.",
					"The development of the PW1120, according to Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) specifications, started in June 1980. It retained the F100 core module, gearbox, fuel pump, forward ducts, as well as the F100 digital electronic control, with only minor modifications. Unique PW1120 components included a wide chord low pressure (LP) compressor, single-stage uncooled low pressure (LP) turbine, simplified single stream augmentor, and a lightweight convergent/divergent nozzle. Full scale testing was initiated in June 1982, and flight clearance of the PW1120 was tested in August 1984. The PW1120 had 70 percent similarity with the F100, so the IDF/AF would not need a special facility for spare parts. It would be built under licence by Bet-Shemesh Engines Limited in Israel.",
					"IAI installed one PW1120 in the starboard nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDF/AF (Number 334/66-0327) to explore the airframe/powerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as Kurnass 2000 (\"Heavy Hammer\") or Super Phantom and to act as an engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant baydoors, new airframe mounted gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic throttle system. It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant control/airframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986.",
					"Two PW1120 powerplants were installed in the same F-4E and it was flown for the first time on 24 April 1987. This proved very successful, allowing the Kurnass 2000 to exceed Mach 1 without the afterburners, and endowing a combat thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.04 (17 per cent better than the F-4E). This improved the sustained turn rate by 15 per cent, the climb rate by 36 per cent, medium-level acceleration by 27 per cent and low-level speed with 18 bombs from 1,046 km/h to 1,120 km/h (654 - 700 mph or 565 kn to 605 kn). It was demonstrated at the Paris Air Show in 1987."

					"The Pratt & Whitney F100 (company designation JTF22) is an afterburning turbofan engine designed and manufactured by Pratt & Whitney to power the U.S. Air Force's \"FX\" initiated in 1965, which became the F-15 Eagle. The engine was to be developed in tandem with the F401 which shares a similar core but with the fan upscaled for the U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat, although the F401 was later abandoned due to costs and reliability issues. The F100 would also power the F-16 Fighting Falcon for the Air Force's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program.",
					"In 1967, the United States Navy and United States Air Force issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX, which became the parallel fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970. This engine program was called the IEDP (Initial Engine Development Program) and was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB. Under ASD, a Systems Project Office Cadre was assigned to manage both the FX Aircraft and Engine definition phase. The Turbine Engine Division of the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory was employed in a support role to assist ASD Systems Engineering in evaluations of technical risks. Later upon selection of the F-15 the ASD engineering cadre became the F-15 Systems Project Office.",
					"The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program.  General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.  At the end of the IEDP, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition, the McDonnell Douglas F-15. The Pratt & Whitney proposal was selected as the winner and the engine was designated the F100. The Air Force would award Pratt & Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would use the engine in the planned F-14B and the XFV-12 project but would cut back and later cancel its order after the latter's failure due to costs and reliability issues, and chose to continue to use the Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14s.",
					"The F100 is a twin spool, axial flow, afterburning turbofan engine. It has a 3-stage fan driven by a two-stage low-pressure turbine and a 10-stage compressor driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine. The initial F100-PW-100 variant generates nearly 24,000 lbf (107 kN) of thrust in full afterburner and weighs approximately 3,000 lb (1,361 kg), achieving its target thrust-to-weight ratio of 8 and providing the F-15 with its desired thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 1:1 at combat weight.",
					"The F100-PW-100 first flew in an F-15 Eagle in 1972 with a maximum continuous power rating of 12,410 lbf (55.2 kN), military power of 14,690 lbf (65.3 kN), and afterburning thrust of 23,930 lbf (106.4 kN) with 5-minute limit. Due to the advanced nature of engine stemming from ambitious performance goals, numerous problems were encountered in its early days of service including high wear, stalling and \"hard\" afterburner starts. These \"hard\" starts could be caused by failure of the afterburner to start or by extinguishing after start, in either case the large jets of jet fuel were lit by the engine exhaust resulting in high pressure waves causing the engine to stall; these stagnation stalls usually occurred at high Mach and high altitude, and could seriously damage the turbine if the condition was not corrected. The problems were contributed by pilots making much more abrupt throttle changes than previous fighters and engines due to the excess thrust available. Early problems were eventually solved by the development of the F100-PW-220 in the early 1980s, which the -100 could be upgraded to.",
					"The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered service with the F100-PW-200; compared to the -100, the -200 has some additional redundancies for single-engine reliability and almost identical thrust ratings. In particular, a \"proximate splitter\" was introduced on the -200 that reduced the severity of the high pressure waves from \"hard\" afterburner starts. This greatly reduced the rate of stagnation stalls, and the -200 on the F-16 saw much better reliability than the -100 on the F-15, although some of the issues from the -100 remained. Similarly, these problems were eventually solved by the F100-PW-220, which the -200 could be upgraded to as well.",
					"Due to the unsatisfactory reliability, maintenance costs, and service life of the F100-100/200, Pratt & Whitney was eventually pressured into upgrading the engine to address these issues. The Air Force also began funding the General Electric F101 Derivative Fighter Engine, which eventually became the F110, as a competitor to the F100 to coerce more urgency from Pratt & Whitney. The result of Pratt & Whitney's improvement efforts was the F100-PW-220, which eliminates almost all stall-stagnations and augmentor instability issues from the -100 as well as doubling time between depot overhauls. Reliability and maintenance costs were also drastically improved, and the engine incorporates a digital electronic engine control (DEEC). The -220 engine produces static thrust of 14,590 lbf (64.9 kN) in military (intermediate) power and 23,770 lbf (105.7 kN) afterburning, very slightly lower than the static thrust of the -100/200, but the -220 has better dynamic thrust across most of the envelope.",
					"The F100-220 was introduced in 1986 and was installed on the F-15 or F-16, gradually replacing the -100/200. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down, the USAF implemented the Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984 (nicknamed \"The Great Engine War\"), under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition; the -220 would be Pratt & Whitney's initial offering in the AFE program, competing with the General Electric F110-GE-100. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with the common engine bay, able to accept the existing F100-200/220 engine (Block 32) or the F110-100 (Block 30). A non-afterburning variant, the F100-PW-220U powers the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV. The -100 and -200 series engines could be upgraded to become equivalent to -220 specifications; the \"E\" abbreviation from 220E is for \"equivalent\" and given to engines which have been upgraded as such.",
					"The F100-PW-229 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-129, were the result of the USAF seeking greater power for its tactical aircraft through the Improved Performance Engine (IPE) program in the 1980s. It was developed under company designation PW1128; in addition to greater thrust, the -229 incorporates the reliability and durability improvements of the -220 as well as an enhanced DEEC. Compared to earlier variants, the -229 has a higher turbine inlet temperature, higher airflow of 248 lb/s (112 kg/s), and lower bypass ratio. The first engine was flown in 1989 and produced thrust of 17,800 lbf (79.2 kN) (dry/intermediate thrust) and 29,160 lbf (129.7 kN) with afterburner. The -229 powers late model F-16C/D Block 52s and F-15Es.",
					"A variant of the -229 fitted with a 3-dimensional axisymmetric thrust vectoring nozzle, referred by Pratt & Whitney as the Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzle (P/YBBN), was tested on the F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles) in the 1990s.",
					"In 2007, the F100-PW-229EEP (Engine Enhancement Package) began development to increase reliability and number of accumulated cycles between depot overhauls. This was done by applying technology from the F100-PW-232 (see below), which in turn incorporated technology and advancements from the F119 program for the F-22, as well as (for -229EEP) from the F135 program for the F-35; the -229EEP incorporates updated turbine materials, cooling management techniques, compressor aerodynamics, split cases (top and bottom) and updated DEEC software. Deliveries of the -229EEP began in 2009.",
					"The F100-PW-232, originally called F100-PW-229A (Advanced), was a further enhanced variant that incorporated engineering advances and technology from Pratt & Whitney's F119 engine for the F-22 as well as operational experience from the -229; development began in the late 1990s. Both the -232 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-132, were designed to make full use of the F-16's Modular Common Inlet Duct (MCID), or \"Big Mouth\" inlet introduced in the Block 30 variant. The fan was larger for increased airflow of 275 lb/s (125 kg/s) and redesigned to be more reliable; it incorporated stages with the blades and disk formed into a single piece called an integrally-blades rotor (IBR), or blisk. The stators were also redesigned for better aerodynamics to improve stall margin. The -232 could produce 20,100 lbf (89.4 kN) of thrust in intermediate power and 32,500 lbf (144.6 kN) in afterburner; alternatively it could produce the same thrust levels as the -229 but increase inspection intervals by 40%. The -232 was not pursued by the USAF, but many of the improvements were incorporated into the -229EEP to increase its reliability and inspection intervals.",
					"The F401 was the naval development of the F100 and designed in tandem. It was intended to power the F-14B Tomcat and Rockwell XFV-12, but the engine was canceled due to costs and development issues. The PW1120 turbofan was a smaller derivative of the F100; it was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW2000, also known by the military designation F117 and initially referred to as the JT10D, is a series of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines with a thrust range from 37,000 to 43,000 lbf (160 to 190 kN). Built by Pratt & Whitney, they were designed for the Boeing 757. As a 757 powerplant, these engines compete with the Rolls-Royce RB211.",
					"Pratt & Whitney began working on the JT10D in October 1971 intended for the McDonnell Douglas YC-15 into the Advanced Medium STOL Transport project and the Boeing 767, then code named 7X7, which first ran in August 1974.  In December 1980, Pratt & Whitney changed to a new naming system for its engines and the JT10D became the PW2037.",
					"The PW2000 is a dual-spool, axial air flow, annular combustion, high bypass turbofan with a dual-channel Full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. It was certified in 1984 as the first civilian FADEC-controlled aviation engine.",
					"MTU Aero Engines holds a 21.2% stake in the engine, having developed the low-pressure turbine and turbine exit casing as well as producing critical parts of the low-pressure turbine, the turbine exhaust casing, high-pressure compressor and high-pressure turbine components.",
					"The first PW2000 series engine, the PW2037, powered the Boeing 757-200 and entered service with Delta Air Lines as the launch customer for the civil aviation version of the engine.",

The powerplant first flew on the C-17 in 1991. Still maintaining the F117 engine for the U.S. military, Pratt & Whitney received a $5.5 billion contract modification in June 2023 for engine sustainment in San Francisco, California; Columbus, Georgia; and Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, through September 2027.",
					"The PW2000 also powered the abortive Ilyushin Il-96M; the engine first flew on the Il-96M in 1993.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW1000G, also called the GTF (geared turbofan), is a high-bypass geared turbofan engine family produced by Pratt & Whitney.After many demonstrators, the program was launched with the PW1200G on the Mitsubishi SpaceJet (later cancelled) in March 2008, first flight tested in July 2008.The first variant to be certified was the PW1500G for the Airbus A220 in February 2013.The program cost is estimated at $10 billion.",
					"The gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure spool allows each to spin at its optimal speed, allowing a higher bypass ratio for a better propulsive efficiency.Pratt & Whitney claims the engine is 16% more fuel efficient than the previous generation, and up to 75% quieter.The first variant to enter service was the PW1100G for the Airbus A320neo in January 2016. The engine had teething problems after its introduction, extending to grounded aircraft and inflight failures, solved afterwards.The variants can generate 15,000 to 33,000 lbf (67 to 147 kN) of thrust.The engine is used on the A220, A320neo family, Embraer E-Jet E2 and Irkut MC-21.",
					"In summer 1993 Pratt & Whitney started to test its 53,000 lbf (240 kN) Advanced Ducted Propulsor (ADP) demonstrator at the NASA Ames wind tunnel, using a 4:1, 40,000 hp (30,000 kW) gearbox.Its 118.2 in (300 cm) fan with 18 reversing pitch composite blades had a 15:1 bypass ratio.It aimed to cut fuel consumption by 6–7%, emissions by 15%, and generate less noise due to lower fan tip speed of 950 ft/s (290 m/s), down from 1,400 ft/s (430 m/s) in conventional 5:1 bypass turbofans.While the gearbox and larger fan weighed more, this was mitigated by using 40% composites by weight, up from 15%.In 1994 P&W was planning to run a 60,000 hp (45,000 kW) gearbox for 75,000 lbf (330 kN) of thrust.",
					"P&W first attempted to build a production geared turbofan starting around 1998, with the PW8000, targeted for the 25,000–35,000 lbf (110–160 kN) range. This was an upgrade of the existing PW6000 that replaced the fan section with a gear box and a new single-stage fan, and aimed for 8–10% lower operating costs, or $600,000 per aircraft annually.",
					"The PW8000 had an 11:1 bypass ratio (twice that of the V2500), a 40:1 overall pressure ratio, and 13 compressor stages instead of the 22 in the V2500 for similar thrusts.Preliminary development was to end by June 1, the first test for 10 months later, and certification 20 months after, for $400 million.Pratt had tested gearboxes for 950 hours for $350 million in the previous decade and aimed for 99.5% efficiency.The ADP gearbox was 30% more powerful and the reversing pitch fan was not retained for the PW8000.P&W was to control 60% of the program, shared with IAE partners MTU and FiatAvio but not Rolls-Royce, and possibly with Volvo and MHI.",
					"Its LP turbine ran at 9,160 rpm, reduced by 3:1 for a 3,250 rpm fan having a 1,050 ft/s (320 m/s) blade tip speed down from 1,400 ft/s (430 m/s), dropping noise to 30 EPNdB cumulated below Stage 3 requirements.The 76–79 in (190–200 cm) fan had 20 titanium blades, and moved 1,369 lb (621 kg) of air per second in climb.The conventional 3-stage LP compressor was followed by a 5-stage, 12:1 HP compressor fitted with 700 blades inspired by the military ATEGG program's low aspect-ratio airfoils.A floatwall/TALON combustor was followed by a single stage HP turbine and a counter rotating 3-stage LP turbine with 400 blades, both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) optimized.The gearbox could handle 50 hp/lb (82 kW/kg). Eight engines would have been used for certification.After several years, the PW8000 project was abandoned.",
					"Soon afterwards the ATFI project appeared, using a PW308 core but with a new gearbox and a single-stage fan.[citation needed] It had its first run on March 16, 2001.[citation needed] This led to the Geared Turbofan (GTF) program, which was based around a newly designed core jointly developed with German MTU Aero Engines.[citation needed]",
					"After the budget of NASA on aeronautics research was severely cut at the start of 2006, Pratt & Whitney committed to spend $100 million a year on the geared turbofan (GTF) development for the next generation of single-aisle airliners, focused on the 25,000–35,000 lbf (110–160 kN) thrust range.By then, P&W was supporting 36% of the engines in the Western-operated commercial fleet, compared to CFM's 33% (growing), GE's 13%, Rolls-Royce's 11%, and IAE' 6% (growing); but it was decreasing as it was mostly based on the older JT8D.The company was hoping the GTF could cut fuel burn by up to 12% and noise by 31dB compared with then-current engines.P&W was planning a ground engine demonstration in late 2007, aimed at 30,000 lbf (130 kN) thrust with a 2 m (80 in)-diameter fan.The first ground test of the demonstrator was performed in November 2007 at West Palm Beach, Florida.",
					"In October 2007, the GTF was selected to power the 70- to 90-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ).In March 2008, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launched the MRJ with an order for 25 aircraft from All Nippon Airways, then targeting a 2013 entry into service.In July 2008, the GTF was renamed PW1000G, the first in a new line of \"PurePower\" engines.",
					"The engine was first tested on the Pratt & Whitney Boeing 747SP on July 11, 2008 through mid-August 2008, totaling 12 flights and 43.5 flight hours. It then flew starting October 14, 2008 on an Airbus A340-600 in Toulouse on the number two pylon.",
					"Testing of the CSeries bound PW1524G model began in October 2010.In addition to the geared turbofan, the initial designs included a variable-area fan nozzle (VAFN), which allows improvements in propulsive efficiency across a range of the flight envelope. However, the VAFN has since been dropped from production designs due to high system weight. The PW1500G engine achieved Transport Canada type certification on February 20, 2013.The first flight test on one of its intended production airframes, the Bombardier CSeries (Airbus A220), was on September 16, 2013.",
					"The A320 engine, the PW1100G, had made its first static engine test run on November 1, 2012, and was first tested on the 747SP on May 15, 2013.The first flight of the Airbus A320neo followed on September 25, 2014. The PW1100G engine achieved FAA type certification on December 19, 2014.The fourth variant of the engine, the PW1900G for the Embraer E2, first flew on November 3, 2015 from Mirabel in Canada fitted to the Boeing 747SP test aircraft.",
					"The program cost is estimated at $10 billion.The list price was $12 million in 2011.At the start of its production in 2016, each GTF was costing PW $10m to build, more than the sale price, but should become less than $2m per engine. MTU provides the first four stages of the high-pressure compressor, the low-pressure turbine and other components. In October 2016, MTU started to deliver the engine assembled on its line to Airbus.",
					"In November 2016, Pratt had fixed the issue of engine start time and wanted to deliver 150 powerplants by the year-end, 50 fewer than originally planned. This was because of low yield of fan blades when less than one-third were passing inspection at the start of the year compared to 75% success for the latest. 350–400 engine deliveries were targeted for 2017. Fuel-burn performance was 16% better than the IAE V2500 baseline, on target, and even 18% better in best cases.",
					"The troubled introduction led to customers choosing the CFM LEAP, which won 396 A320neo orders compared to 39 for the GTF from January through early August 2017: 46% of the GTF-powered A320neos were out of service for at least one week in July 2017 compared with just 9% of those using the LEAP. The GTF's market share fell from 45% to 40% in 2016, but 1,523 planes (29%) were still undecided, and as of August 2017 Pratt had an 8,000 engine orderbook including 1,000 non-Airbus planes. ",
					"On 24 October 2017, a 99.8% dispatch reliability was attained and Pratt remained on track to deliver 350 to 400 engines in 2017, as 254 have been delivered including 120 in the third quarter, but 12–15% were diverted for spares as the carbon air seal and combustor liners were wearing out quickly, requiring engine removals to change the part.P&W expects to deliver over 2,500 GTFs from 2018 to 2020, more than 10,000 engines by 2025.",
					"After 15 PW1200Gs for the Mitsubishi MRJ development were built in Mirabel and Middletown, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries started final assembly in Nagoya in mid 2018 for the MRJ 2020 introduction.Icing, thermal environment, stall, drainage, performance, operability and other development tests were completed.MHI manufactures the combustor and high-pressure turbine disks.The first engine was completed by November 2019.",
					"In 2010, Pratt & Whitney launched the development of an ultra high-bypass version, with a ratio significantly higher than the PW1100G's 12.2:1 for the A320neo, to improve fuel consumption by 20% compared to a CFM56-7 and reduced noise relative to the FAA's Stage 4 by 25 dB.In 2012, wind tunnel tests were completed on an earlier version of the fan and in 2015, 275h of testing were completed on a fan rig.More than 175h of ground testing of key components were completed in October 2017, on a shorter duct inlet, a part of the nacelle and a fan with lower-pressure ratio blades, significantly fewer than the 20 blades of the PW1100G.The US FAA Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program sponsors the tests, with its technologies to be validated in a flight test campaign.It could power the Boeing New Midsize Airplane in the mid-2020s and Airbus' response, and would compete against the Rolls-Royce UltraFan and a CFM LEAP higher-thrust version.",
					"In December 2021, Pratt & Whitney announced an updated GTF Advantage version of the A320neo's PW1100G available from 2024, after over a year of ground and flight testing.It offers 1% more fuel efficiency, more durability and more thrust with 34,000 lbf (151 kN), up to 8% more than before at hot and high airports.This is achieved through more flow into the core; a tweaked active clearance control between the turbine and seals, a reduction of temperature in the high-pressure compressor; improved, more durable coatings and more damage-resistant blisk rotors.Some improvements could trickle down to the other variants.",
					"The family of engines generates 15,000 to 34,000 lbf (67 to 151 kN) of thrust, it uses gearboxes rated between 16,000 hp (12,000 kW) and 32,000 hp (24,000 kW).By putting a 3:1 gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure spool, each spins at its optimal speed: 4,000–5,000 RPM for the fan and 12,000–15,000 RPM for the spool, the high-pressure spool spinning at more than 20,000 RPM.The PW1431G variant has a compression ratio of 42.As the geared fan is slower, the tensile stresses on the blades are reduced, allowing high-strength aluminum alloys.The A320 PW1100G fan has 20 blades, down from 36 in the CFM56-5B.",
					"Pratt & Whitney claims the PW1000G is 16% more fuel efficient than current engines used on regional jets and single-aisle jets, as well as being up to 75% quieter.As the higher bypass ratio and gear leverage a higher propulsive efficiency, there is less need for a high performance engine core than the CFM LEAP, leaving a larger fuel burn gain margin of 5–7% over the next decade, averaging 1% per year combined with gear ratio tweaks. The PW1400G has a cruise Thrust-specific fuel consumption of 0.51 lb/lbf/h (14.4 g/kN/s). ",
					"The 30,000-horsepower (22,000-kilowatt) gearbox is designed as a lifetime item with no scheduled maintenance other than changing oil.It has up to 25,000 cycles LLPs, 25% better than others at 20,000 cycles, reducing maintenance costs, while the fan gear has no limit. The fan drive gear system (FDGS) is expected to stay on wing for 30,000 flight hours or more before it needs its first overhaul.",
					"The first delivery to a commercial operator, an A320neo to Lufthansa, occurred on January 20, 2016.  It entered commercial use later that month.. As of early August 2017, Pratt was supporting 75 aircraft: 59 Airbus A320neos with PW1100Gs and 16 Airbus A220s with PW1500Gs.. In January 2018, it reached 500,000 flight hours on a fleet of 135 aircraft flown by 21 operators.. Due to teething problems, overall losses on the GTF program rose to $1.2 billion.",
					"In May 2018, after receiving and operating five A320neos, Spirit Airlines confirms a fuel burn reduction better than the 15% promised, perhaps by 1%–2%. Air Lease Corporation's A320neos deliveries are 11 months late but its executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy believes 12–18 months will be needed to get back to normal.On 17 July 2018, Pratt & Whitney announced that the PW1500G had been granted ETOPS 180 approval by the FAA.",
					"The first delivery was to Lufthansa instead of Qatar Airways due to rotor bow, or thermal bowing, due to asymmetrical cooling after shut-down on the previous flight. Differences in temperature across the shaft section supporting the rotor lead to different thermal deformation of the shaft material, causing the rotor axis to bend; this results in an offset between the center of gravity of the bowed rotor and the bearing axis, causing a slight imbalance and potentially reducing the tight clearance between the rotor blade tips and the compressor wall. All production standard engines now feature a damper on the third and fourth shaft bearings to help stiffen the shaft and data from engines in service and under accelerated testing is expected to gradually reduce engine start times. According to P&W President Bob Leduc, \"by the time we get to June (2016), it will be down to 200 seconds for start time and by the time we get to December (2016) we will be down to 150 seconds for start time\".",
					"In an earnings briefing on 26 July the CEO of Pratt & Whitney's parent company United Technologies Gregory Hayes stated when asked about the start up issues on the PW1100G-JM; \"On the technical stuff, I would tell you it is in the rearview mirror. The start time with the software drops have been pretty well addressed\". Airbus group chief Tom Enders said while releasing Airbus's 2016 first half financial results that the first upgraded \"golden engine\" would be delivered to Lufthansa in early August 2016.",
					"Initially, the PW1000G start up sequence took about seven minutes, compared to one to two and a half minute startups on the similar CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines; hardware fixes and software upgrades decreased the time required by a little over a minute, and cooling down both engines at the same time saved slightly over two minutes, for a total reduction of three and a half minutes. These modifications were included on new-build engines, as well as retrofitting existing units. Pratt & Whitney continued to improve start up times, with fuel-nozzle modifications and oil filling procedure changes expected to save another minute when introduced by the end of 2017.",
					"To create a better seal and reduce cooling time by 1 min, a cubic boron nitride coating was applied to the 11 integrally bladed rotors  tips: the A321neo production engines start times will be similar to the V2500.",
					"As IndiGo and Go Air operate in a humid, hot, polluted and salty environment, 42 engines were prematurely removed from those companies' aircraft by 24 February, with more removals scheduled, after warnings, mandatory checks, and possible repairs were due after only three flight hours instead of ten. 28 engine removals were due to an air seal leakage in the third bearing, which allowed metal particles to enter the oil system, triggering detectors. Pratt & Whitney discovered these issues in 2015 and revised the design in 2016 after the 160th engine with improved bearing compartments and damping for the third and fourth bearings to offset the rotor-bow, with the repairs retrofitted on-wing after testing at Airbus and Pratt. Boosting durability of the third bearing compartment air seal, the upgraded carbon seal package was certified on April 12 and can be retrofitted over a typical night stop.",
					"Thirteen engine removals were due to borescope inspections revealing blocked cooling holes in combustion chamber panels, apparently due to saltier air, and Pratt & Whitney developed and tested a more durable combustor design to address a tone problem, to be introduced in September.Spirit Airlines reported that the bleed air system froze shut on occasion due to cold temperatures on four of its five A320neos, a problem also experienced by IndiGo, leading Spirit to impose a 30,000 feet (9,100 m) ceiling on their aircraft.  To avoid troubles with the P&W1100G engines, JetBlue Airways switched its first three Airbus A321neos in 2018 to A321ceos, deferring delivery of its first A321neos to 2019 among its order for 60.",
					"In 2017, IndiGo had to ground seven planes, two in May, four in June and one in July after, their engines out of service, waiting for upgrades: a lack of spare parts—grounding also All Nippon Airways and Hong Kong Express Airways A320s—has been compounded by a new Indian tax on goods and services, impeding imports.With removals without sufficient spare engines available, the airline had to ground as many as nine jets on some days, operations disruptions are understood by Pratt & Whitney which struggles to fix glitches and sent compensation while design changes could take a year and sorting out the issue one and a half years.Indigo had to replace 69 engines from mid 2016 till early 2018.",
					"In February 2018, after in-flight failures of PW1100G with its high pressure compressor aft hub modified – apparently problems of its knife edge seal, the EASA and Airbus grounded some A320neo family aircraft until they are fitted with spares. Later, Airbus decided to stop accepting additional PW1100G engines for A320neo aircraft.Despite the part failure that could hold up engine deliveries to Airbus until April, P&W reaffirmed its 2018 delivery goal of doubling its 2017 rate of 374 engines as nearly 100 engines delivered to Airbus are problematic, including 43 in service.",
					"To solve the issue, a revised configuration with a mature and approved design will be released from early March engine deliveries.The EASA and FAA imposed flying A320neos with mixed engines and forbid ETOPS, but the Indian DGCA went further and grounded all A320neo with an affected engine.The design flaw will cost Pratt & Whitney $50 million to resolve.P&W will replace the seals in the 55 engines delivered to Airbus and in the 43 in-service GTFs, as the target of 750 deliveries in 2018 seems more remote.",
					"By September 2018, the A320neo's PW1100Gs were experiencing increasing engine vibrations, sometimes before 1,000 flight hours and mostly at high power settings in the climb phase, requiring an early engine change.Lufthansa's A320neos were grounded 254 days since first delivery, 13 times worse than for its A320ceos, 78% of the time due to engine issues as 14 unplanned engine changes were made. In September 2018 its A320neos utilization was half of its A320ceos.By the end of November, Airbus planned to explain the root cause and give an in-depth analysis by the end of 2018.  Pratt & Whitney stated the A220's and Embraer E2's PW1500G/PW1900Gs are free from the issue and that less than 2% of PW1100Gs are affected while 182 GTF-powered A320/A321neos have been delivered.",
					"In 2018 some engines were reported as emitting \"a strange howling noise\" as heard by people below the aircraft as it made its landing approach. Pratt & Whitney had not established what was causing the noise at that time.",
					"By October 2018 about 10 P&W-powered A320neos were typically grounded for repairs at any given time.",
					"Pratt & Whitney has reduced life limits on PW1500G (installed on the Airbus A220) and PW1900G (installed on Embraer E190/E195-E20) high-pressure compressor front hubs after corrosion was discovered during routine engine overhaul. This corrosion reduces the low-cycle fatigue capability and may lead to cracking before the component reaches its life limit.",
					"In March 2023 Indian operator Go First suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy, initially until May 2023, later until July 2023. The airline cited poor reliability of the PW1100G engines as reason for suspension and claimed that Pratt & Whitney did not comply with a previous arbitration settlement to supply spare engines. Pratt & Whitney disputed the claims.",
					"In July 2023 P&W recalled 1,200 of its 3,000 geared turbofan engines for earlier than expected inspection due to the discovery of contamination in the metal used to manufacture some engine parts with the potential to cause cracks. In September of 2023, P&W updated this recall to include all 3,000 engines, driving 600-700 excess shop visits from 2024-2026 (because most of the engines were expected to have a shop visit anyway during this period). P&W estimated that the metal contamination issue will cost Pratt & Whitney and its partners $6 to $7 billion, 80% of which is customer compensation.",
					"Indian airline IndiGo reported four incidents involving in-flight engine stall during climb followed by shutdown, which occurred on the 24th, 25th and 26 October 2019. The cause of the shutdowns has been traced to problems with the Low-Pressure Turbine (LPT). On 1 November 2019 the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) asked IndiGo to replace engines on all of the 98 A320 Neo airplanes it currently operates by January 31, 2020 and suggested to defer future deliveries until the existing fleet is re-engined. Later DGCA extended the deadline to May 31, 2020.",
					"On 13 October 2018, an Airbus A220-100 operated by Swiss International Air Lines had an inflight shutdown of one of its PW1500G engines after a faulty O-ring seal on the engine's fuel oil cooler led to a loss of oil pressure.",
					"On 25 July 2019, an Airbus A220-300 operated by Swiss International Air Lines had an engine failure and diverted to Paris–Charles de Gaulle. The low-pressure compressor of one its PW1500G engines disintegrated while climbing through 32,000 ft.",
					"On 16 September 2019, a similar accident happened just before reaching 35,000 ft and the crew returned to Geneva. The inspection has shown that \"stage-one rotor in the low-pressure compressor had separated and there was a hole in the compressor case\". On 26 September the FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating borescope inspections on the engines.",
					"On 15 October 2019, another engine failed and the crew diverted to Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Swiss withdrew its fleet for inspection. Swiss returned some aircraft to flight status the same day after engine checks and planned to restore flight operations by 17 October. A software update may cause damaging vibrations of fast-moving parts, causing the failures.",
					"After those engine failures, Transport Canada issued an emergency airworthiness directive limiting the power to 94% of N1 (low pressure spool) above 29,000 ft (8,800 m), disengaging the autothrottle for the climb over this altitude before engaging it again in cruise. For the PW1500G, N1 is the Low Pressure Spool, with a nominal speed of 10,600 RPM, with the fan geared with a ratio of 1:3.0625 (nominal speed 3461 RPM). The top of climb is the most demanding point for a turbofan, where the compressor spins the fastest. The directive states that \"high altitude climbs at higher thrust settings for engines with certain thrust ratings\" may be a contributor to the failures, and cautions that \"this condition, if not corrected, could lead to an uncontained failure of the engine and damage to the aeroplane\". The EASA adopted the directive, and others are expected to follow.",
					"The engines involved in the July and September incidents had 154 and 230 cycles, respectively, while the October failure occurred to an engine with 1,654 cycles since new but within 300 cycles after an electronic engine-control update. Pratt & Whitney recommends inspections on engines with up to 300 cycles after the update.",
					"Another PW1500G suffered an uncontained engine failure, on 12 February 2020 aboard A220-300 belonging to Air Baltic during flight BT-677 from Riga, Latvia to Malaga, Spain ",
					"Following these Airbus A220 PW1500G failures, the similar PW1900G electronic control software was upgraded for the Embraer E195-E2 in 2021.",
					"To address the issue for the PW1500G, Pratt & Whitney developed a software update for the engine control system that was specifically designed to improve engine performance during all flight operations. The update was first approved by the FAA in March 2019, and was subsequently incorporated into the engines of a number of Airbus A220 aircraft. The software update addressed the root cause of the compression stall problem by adjusting the engine's control logic to provide more consistent and stable airflow through the engine core. This was achieved by optimizing the engine's inlet guide vanes and airflow sensors, as well as altering the engine's response to certain flight conditions. ",
					"Pratt & Whitney also conducted a comprehensive review of the PW1500G engine and its components to identify any other potential issues. Extensive testing and data analysis and resulted in further modifications to the engine's design and performance characteristics.",
					"As of June 2023, there have been no other reported incidents of compression stalls on PW1500G-powered aircraft since the software update was implemented.",
					"It has been proposed for the Sukhoi Superjet 130, and the Rekkof Aircraft F-120NG [nl]."

				"name": "Pratt_&_Whitney_F119",
				"data": [
					"The Pratt & Whitney F119, company designation PW5000, is an afterburning turbofan engine developed by Pratt & Whitney for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, which resulted in the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The engine delivers thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class and was designed for sustained supersonic flight without afterburners, or supercruise. Delivering almost 22% more thrust with 40% fewer parts than its F100 predecessor, the F119 allows the F-22 to achieve supercruise speeds of up to Mach 1.8. The F119's nozzles incorporate thrust vectoring that enable them to direct the engine thrust ±20° in the pitch axis to give the F-22 enhanced maneuverability.",
					"The F119 is also the basis for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion system, with variants powering both the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrators. The X-35 won the JSF competition and the production Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is powered by an F119 derivative, the Pratt & Whitney F135 which produces up to 43,000 lbf (191 kN) of thrust.",
					"The F119 resulted from the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). Detailed design of Pratt & Whitney's submission, designated internally as PW5000, began when the request for proposals (RFP) for JAFE, later renamed ATF Engine, was released in May 1983. Advances in engine technology, such as those from the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) and the Joint Technology Demonstration Engine (JTDE) programs, allowed the design to do more work with fewer stages, with the PW5000's compressor having only 6 stages compared to the 10 stages in the F100's compressor. The high pressure and low pressure turbines were single stage and counter-rotating, which reduced the gyroscopic forces on the engine; it was hoped that counter-rotation would eliminate a row of turbine stators, which would save weight and reduce parts count, but this was ultimately not successful and the stators were retained. The fan and compressor stages were to use integrally bladed rotors (IBR), also known as blisks, to reduce weight and cost and improve performance. Owing to the ATF's demanding requirements for supercruise, the PW5000 design has low bypass ratio, high core and turbine inlet temperatures, and a fully variable convergent-divergent nozzle to achieve high specific thrust in intermediate, or non-afterburning power. The combustor, internally named Floatwall, eliminated welds to mitigate crack growth due to thermal cycling. The original RFP called for maximum thrust in the 30,000 lbf (133 kN) class for an aircraft gross weight of 50,000 lb (22,700 kg).",
					"Pratt & Whitney and General Electric were selected to make prototype engines, designated YF119 and YF120 respectively, for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val). Both engine makers would provide engines for both the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 and the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 ATF technology and flight demonstrators. The ATF's increasing weight during development required more thrust to meet the performance requirements; as gross weight grew to 60,000 lb (27,200 kg), the required maximum thrust was increased by 20% to 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. Pratt & Whitney's design changed to incorporate a 15% larger fan, increasing bypass ratio from 0.25 to 0.30. However, unlike General Electric, Pratt & Whitney did not fit its larger fan on flightworthy YF119s for the ATF flight demonstrators to avoid potential reliability issues that may arise. Instead, the revised fan was extensively ground tested at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. As a result, both the YF-22 and YF-23 had lower performance with the YF119s than with the YF120s.",
					"On 3 August 1991, Pratt & Whitney was awarded the EMD contract for ATF engine, while the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics team won the contract for the ATF airframe. While the YF119 was a more conventional design compared to the General Electric's variable cycle YF120, Pratt & Whitney accrued far greater test hours and emphasized reliability and the lower risk. Ground tests of the F119-PW-100 were first conducted in February 1993. The production engines were fitted on the production F-22, and were first flown on the F-22's maiden flight on 7 September 1997. A total of 507 engines were produced. In 2013 Pratt & Whitney assisted the F119 Heavy Maintenance Center (HMC) at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma in the first F119 depot overhaul.",
					"Turbine engine advances from ATEGG and JTDE continued with the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, with applications in F119 improvement packages and derivatives. Prototype YF119 variants powered the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) concept demonstrator aircraft, and subsequent full scale development of the F119 derivative resulted in the F135 family of engines that powers the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.",
					"The F119 is a twin-spool axial-flow low-bypass turbofan. It has a three-stage fan driven by a single-stage low pressure turbine and six-stage high pressure compressor driven by single-stage high pressure turbine. The shroud-less fan has wide-chord, low aspect ratio hollow titanium fan blades that are linear-friction welded to the disks to form single-piece integrally-bladed rotors (IBRs), or blisks. The compressor stators and thrust-vectoring nozzle use a burn-resistant titanium alloy called Alloy C, with the first row of vanes variable in order to increase surge margin. The Floatwall annular combustor is lined with high-cobalt material for oxidation resistance and combustion chamber durability, and ensures the clean burning of the fuel and reduced NOx generation. The high-pressure turbine blades are made of single-crystal superalloys and impingement cooled using air from the high-pressure compressor. The high and low pressure spools are counter-rotating. The requirement for the ATF to supercruise, or fly supersonic without afterburners, results in a very low bypass ratio of 0.30 for the F119-PW-100 in order to achieve high specific thrust. The F119 has dual-redundant full authority digital engine control (FADEC), also referred to internally as Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), supplied by Hamilton Standard and fully integrated into the F-22's vehicle management system.",
					"The three-zone afterburner, or augmentor, contributes to the stealth of the aircraft by having fuel injectors integrated into thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). These vanes replace the traditional fuel spray bars and flame holders and block line-of-sight of the turbines. The convergent-divergent nozzle can vector ±20° in the pitch axis, which greatly improves the aircraft's pitch authority by augmenting the pitching moment of the tail with engine thrust; this enables the F-22 to remain controllable while flying at a trimmed alpha of over 60°. The thrust vectoring is fully integrated into the F-22's flight control system to facilitate handling. The rectangular nozzle consists two wedge-shaped flaps for stealth and also contribute to lower infrared signature by flattening the exhaust plume and facilitating its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices.",
					"The F119 has a design life of 8,650 total accumulated cycles, with overhaul of the hot section approximately every 2,000 hours and the cold section every 4,000 hours.",
					"While the production F119 on the F-22 incorporates rectangular thrust vectoring nozzles, prototype variants on other aircraft had different nozzle solutions that are tailored to the airframe.",
					"The YF119 on the YF-23 had a single-expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) consisting of a variable wedge flap on the top and a fixed ramp on the bottom, which then transitions to a trench on top of the aft fuselage. While the SERN lacked thrust vectoring capability, it allowed the exhaust to be further cooled in the trenches, significantly reducing infrared signature when viewed from below the aircraft; the trenches in the aft deck were lined with tiles that were \"transpiration cooled\" from engine bleed air to withstand the heat of the exhaust.",
					"The specialized YF119 variants on the X-32 and X-35 had provisions for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations. The YF119-PW-614 on the X-32 had a pitch-axis thrust vectoring nozzle and valves can redirect the engine exhaust and bleed air to provide direct lift, similar to the Pegasus engine on the Harrier. In contrast, YF119-PW-611 on the X-35 had a round axisymmetric nozzle that can swivel downwards while the low-pressure spool drives a lift fan that's engaged through a clutch; engine bypass air is also routed to roll posts for additional lift and stability. The X-35 won the JSF competition and its shaft-driven lift fan system, called LiftSystem, was fully developed by Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney for the F135-PW-600.",

However, tests revealed that the initial five-stage high compressor based design did not meet promised fuel burn performance. As a result, many of the original customers switched their orders to the rival CFM56-5.

					"The Pratt & Whitney F100 (company designation JTF22) is an afterburning turbofan engine designed and manufactured by Pratt & Whitney to power the U.S. Air Force's \"FX\" initiated in 1965, which became the F-15 Eagle. The engine was to be developed in tandem with the F401 which shares a similar core but with the fan upscaled for the U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat, although the F401 was later abandoned due to costs and reliability issues. The F100 would also power the F-16 Fighting Falcon for the Air Force's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program.",
					"In 1967, the United States Navy and United States Air Force issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX, which became the parallel fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970. This engine program was called the IEDP (Initial Engine Development Program) and was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB. Under ASD, a Systems Project Office Cadre was assigned to manage both the FX Aircraft and Engine definition phase. The Turbine Engine Division of the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory was employed in a support role to assist ASD Systems Engineering in evaluations of technical risks. Later upon selection of the F-15 the ASD engineering cadre became the F-15 Systems Project Office.",
					"The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program.  General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.  At the end of the IEDP, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition, the McDonnell Douglas F-15. The Pratt & Whitney proposal was selected as the winner and the engine was designated the F100. The Air Force would award Pratt & Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would use the engine in the planned F-14B and the XFV-12 project but would cut back and later cancel its order after the latter's failure due to costs and reliability issues, and chose to continue to use the Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14s.",
					"The F100 is a twin spool, axial flow, afterburning turbofan engine. It has a 3-stage fan driven by a two-stage low-pressure turbine and a 10-stage compressor driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine. The initial F100-PW-100 variant generates nearly 24,000 lbf (107 kN) of thrust in full afterburner and weighs approximately 3,000 lb (1,361 kg), achieving its target thrust-to-weight ratio of 8 and providing the F-15 with its desired thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 1:1 at combat weight.",
					"The F100-PW-100 first flew in an F-15 Eagle in 1972 with a maximum continuous power rating of 12,410 lbf (55.2 kN), military power of 14,690 lbf (65.3 kN), and afterburning thrust of 23,930 lbf (106.4 kN) with 5-minute limit. Due to the advanced nature of engine stemming from ambitious performance goals, numerous problems were encountered in its early days of service including high wear, stalling and \"hard\" afterburner starts. These \"hard\" starts could be caused by failure of the afterburner to start or by extinguishing after start, in either case the large jets of jet fuel were lit by the engine exhaust resulting in high pressure waves causing the engine to stall; these stagnation stalls usually occurred at high Mach and high altitude, and could seriously damage the turbine if the condition was not corrected. The problems were contributed by pilots making much more abrupt throttle changes than previous fighters and engines due to the excess thrust available. Early problems were eventually solved by the development of the F100-PW-220 in the early 1980s, which the -100 could be upgraded to.",
					"The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered service with the F100-PW-200; compared to the -100, the -200 has some additional redundancies for single-engine reliability and almost identical thrust ratings. In particular, a \"proximate splitter\" was introduced on the -200 that reduced the severity of the high pressure waves from \"hard\" afterburner starts. This greatly reduced the rate of stagnation stalls, and the -200 on the F-16 saw much better reliability than the -100 on the F-15, although some of the issues from the -100 remained. Similarly, these problems were eventually solved by the F100-PW-220, which the -200 could be upgraded to as well.",
					"Due to the unsatisfactory reliability, maintenance costs, and service life of the F100-100/200, Pratt & Whitney was eventually pressured into upgrading the engine to address these issues. The Air Force also began funding the General Electric F101 Derivative Fighter Engine, which eventually became the F110, as a competitor to the F100 to coerce more urgency from Pratt & Whitney. The result of Pratt & Whitney's improvement efforts was the F100-PW-220, which eliminates almost all stall-stagnations and augmentor instability issues from the -100 as well as doubling time between depot overhauls. Reliability and maintenance costs were also drastically improved, and the engine incorporates a digital electronic engine control (DEEC). The -220 engine produces static thrust of 14,590 lbf (64.9 kN) in military (intermediate) power and 23,770 lbf (105.7 kN) afterburning, very slightly lower than the static thrust of the -100/200, but the -220 has better dynamic thrust across most of the envelope.",
					"The F100-220 was introduced in 1986 and was installed on the F-15 or F-16, gradually replacing the -100/200. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down, the USAF implemented the Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984 (nicknamed \"The Great Engine War\"), under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition; the -220 would be Pratt & Whitney's initial offering in the AFE program, competing with the General Electric F110-GE-100. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with the common engine bay, able to accept the existing F100-200/220 engine (Block 32) or the F110-100 (Block 30). A non-afterburning variant, the F100-PW-220U powers the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV. The -100 and -200 series engines could be upgraded to become equivalent to -220 specifications; the \"E\" abbreviation from 220E is for \"equivalent\" and given to engines which have been upgraded as such.",
					"The F100-PW-229 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-129, were the result of the USAF seeking greater power for its tactical aircraft through the Improved Performance Engine (IPE) program in the 1980s. It was developed under company designation PW1128; in addition to greater thrust, the -229 incorporates the reliability and durability improvements of the -220 as well as an enhanced DEEC. Compared to earlier variants, the -229 has a higher turbine inlet temperature, higher airflow of 248 lb/s (112 kg/s), and lower bypass ratio. The first engine was flown in 1989 and produced thrust of 17,800 lbf (79.2 kN) (dry/intermediate thrust) and 29,160 lbf (129.7 kN) with afterburner. The -229 powers late model F-16C/D Block 52s and F-15Es.",
					"A variant of the -229 fitted with a 3-dimensional axisymmetric thrust vectoring nozzle, referred by Pratt & Whitney as the Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzle (P/YBBN), was tested on the F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles) in the 1990s.",
					"In 2007, the F100-PW-229EEP (Engine Enhancement Package) began development to increase reliability and number of accumulated cycles between depot overhauls. This was done by applying technology from the F100-PW-232 (see below), which in turn incorporated technology and advancements from the F119 program for the F-22, as well as (for -229EEP) from the F135 program for the F-35; the -229EEP incorporates updated turbine materials, cooling management techniques, compressor aerodynamics, split cases (top and bottom) and updated DEEC software. Deliveries of the -229EEP began in 2009.",
					"The F100-PW-232, originally called F100-PW-229A (Advanced), was a further enhanced variant that incorporated engineering advances and technology from Pratt & Whitney's F119 engine for the F-22 as well as operational experience from the -229; development began in the late 1990s. Both the -232 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-132, were designed to make full use of the F-16's Modular Common Inlet Duct (MCID), or \"Big Mouth\" inlet introduced in the Block 30 variant. The fan was larger for increased airflow of 275 lb/s (125 kg/s) and redesigned to be more reliable; it incorporated stages with the blades and disk formed into a single piece called an integrally-blades rotor (IBR), or blisk. The stators were also redesigned for better aerodynamics to improve stall margin. The -232 could produce 20,100 lbf (89.4 kN) of thrust in intermediate power and 32,500 lbf (144.6 kN) in afterburner; alternatively it could produce the same thrust levels as the -229 but increase inspection intervals by 40%. The -232 was not pursued by the USAF, but many of the improvements were incorporated into the -229EEP to increase its reliability and inspection intervals.",
					"The F401 was the naval development of the F100 and designed in tandem. It was intended to power the F-14B Tomcat and Rockwell XFV-12, but the engine was canceled due to costs and development issues. The PW1120 turbofan was a smaller derivative of the F100; it was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.",

Engine failures during the flight test program resulted in thirty aircraft being parked outside the factory with concrete blocks hanging from the pylons, awaiting redesigned engines.Boeing and Pratt & Whitney worked together in 1969 to solve the problem. The trouble was traced to ovalization, in which stresses during takeoff caused the engine casing to deform into an oval shape resulting in rubbing of high-pressure turbine blade tips. This was solved by strengthening the engine casing and adding yoke-shaped thrust links.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney F119, company designation PW5000, is an afterburning turbofan engine developed by Pratt & Whitney for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, which resulted in the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The engine delivers thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class and was designed for sustained supersonic flight without afterburners, or supercruise. Delivering almost 22% more thrust with 40% fewer parts than its F100 predecessor, the F119 allows the F-22 to achieve supercruise speeds of up to Mach 1.8. The F119's nozzles incorporate thrust vectoring that enable them to direct the engine thrust ±20° in the pitch axis to give the F-22 enhanced maneuverability.",
					"The F119 is also the basis for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion system, with variants powering both the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrators. The X-35 won the JSF competition and the production Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is powered by an F119 derivative, the Pratt & Whitney F135 which produces up to 43,000 lbf (191 kN) of thrust.",
					"The F119 resulted from the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). Detailed design of Pratt & Whitney's submission, designated internally as PW5000, began when the request for proposals (RFP) for JAFE, later renamed ATF Engine, was released in May 1983. Advances in engine technology, such as those from the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) and the Joint Technology Demonstration Engine (JTDE) programs, allowed the design to do more work with fewer stages, with the PW5000's compressor having only 6 stages compared to the 10 stages in the F100's compressor. The high pressure and low pressure turbines were single stage and counter-rotating, which reduced the gyroscopic forces on the engine; it was hoped that counter-rotation would eliminate a row of turbine stators, which would save weight and reduce parts count, but this was ultimately not successful and the stators were retained. The fan and compressor stages were to use integrally bladed rotors (IBR), also known as blisks, to reduce weight and cost and improve performance. Owing to the ATF's demanding requirements for supercruise, the PW5000 design has low bypass ratio, high core and turbine inlet temperatures, and a fully variable convergent-divergent nozzle to achieve high specific thrust in intermediate, or non-afterburning power. The combustor, internally named Floatwall, eliminated welds to mitigate crack growth due to thermal cycling. The original RFP called for maximum thrust in the 30,000 lbf (133 kN) class for an aircraft gross weight of 50,000 lb (22,700 kg).",
					"Pratt & Whitney and General Electric were selected to make prototype engines, designated YF119 and YF120 respectively, for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val). Both engine makers would provide engines for both the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 and the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 ATF technology and flight demonstrators. The ATF's increasing weight during development required more thrust to meet the performance requirements; as gross weight grew to 60,000 lb (27,200 kg), the required maximum thrust was increased by 20% to 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. Pratt & Whitney's design changed to incorporate a 15% larger fan, increasing bypass ratio from 0.25 to 0.30. However, unlike General Electric, Pratt & Whitney did not fit its larger fan on flightworthy YF119s for the ATF flight demonstrators to avoid potential reliability issues that may arise. Instead, the revised fan was extensively ground tested at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. As a result, both the YF-22 and YF-23 had lower performance with the YF119s than with the YF120s.",
					"On 3 August 1991, Pratt & Whitney was awarded the EMD contract for ATF engine, while the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics team won the contract for the ATF airframe. While the YF119 was a more conventional design compared to the General Electric's variable cycle YF120, Pratt & Whitney accrued far greater test hours and emphasized reliability and the lower risk. Ground tests of the F119-PW-100 were first conducted in February 1993. The production engines were fitted on the production F-22, and were first flown on the F-22's maiden flight on 7 September 1997. A total of 507 engines were produced. In 2013 Pratt & Whitney assisted the F119 Heavy Maintenance Center (HMC) at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma in the first F119 depot overhaul.",
					"Turbine engine advances from ATEGG and JTDE continued with the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, with applications in F119 improvement packages and derivatives. Prototype YF119 variants powered the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) concept demonstrator aircraft, and subsequent full scale development of the F119 derivative resulted in the F135 family of engines that powers the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.",
					"The F119 is a twin-spool axial-flow low-bypass turbofan. It has a three-stage fan driven by a single-stage low pressure turbine and six-stage high pressure compressor driven by single-stage high pressure turbine. The shroud-less fan has wide-chord, low aspect ratio hollow titanium fan blades that are linear-friction welded to the disks to form single-piece integrally-bladed rotors (IBRs), or blisks. The compressor stators and thrust-vectoring nozzle use a burn-resistant titanium alloy called Alloy C, with the first row of vanes variable in order to increase surge margin. The Floatwall annular combustor is lined with high-cobalt material for oxidation resistance and combustion chamber durability, and ensures the clean burning of the fuel and reduced NOx generation. The high-pressure turbine blades are made of single-crystal superalloys and impingement cooled using air from the high-pressure compressor. The high and low pressure spools are counter-rotating. The requirement for the ATF to supercruise, or fly supersonic without afterburners, results in a very low bypass ratio of 0.30 for the F119-PW-100 in order to achieve high specific thrust. The F119 has dual-redundant full authority digital engine control (FADEC), also referred to internally as Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), supplied by Hamilton Standard and fully integrated into the F-22's vehicle management system.",
					"The three-zone afterburner, or augmentor, contributes to the stealth of the aircraft by having fuel injectors integrated into thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). These vanes replace the traditional fuel spray bars and flame holders and block line-of-sight of the turbines. The convergent-divergent nozzle can vector ±20° in the pitch axis, which greatly improves the aircraft's pitch authority by augmenting the pitching moment of the tail with engine thrust; this enables the F-22 to remain controllable while flying at a trimmed alpha of over 60°. The thrust vectoring is fully integrated into the F-22's flight control system to facilitate handling. The rectangular nozzle consists two wedge-shaped flaps for stealth and also contribute to lower infrared signature by flattening the exhaust plume and facilitating its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices.",
					"The F119 has a design life of 8,650 total accumulated cycles, with overhaul of the hot section approximately every 2,000 hours and the cold section every 4,000 hours.",
					"While the production F119 on the F-22 incorporates rectangular thrust vectoring nozzles, prototype variants on other aircraft had different nozzle solutions that are tailored to the airframe.",
					"The YF119 on the YF-23 had a single-expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) consisting of a variable wedge flap on the top and a fixed ramp on the bottom, which then transitions to a trench on top of the aft fuselage. While the SERN lacked thrust vectoring capability, it allowed the exhaust to be further cooled in the trenches, significantly reducing infrared signature when viewed from below the aircraft; the trenches in the aft deck were lined with tiles that were \"transpiration cooled\" from engine bleed air to withstand the heat of the exhaust.",
					"The specialized YF119 variants on the X-32 and X-35 had provisions for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations. The YF119-PW-614 on the X-32 had a pitch-axis thrust vectoring nozzle and valves can redirect the engine exhaust and bleed air to provide direct lift, similar to the Pegasus engine on the Harrier. In contrast, YF119-PW-611 on the X-35 had a round axisymmetric nozzle that can swivel downwards while the low-pressure spool drives a lift fan that's engaged through a clutch; engine bypass air is also routed to roll posts for additional lift and stability. The X-35 won the JSF competition and its shaft-driven lift fan system, called LiftSystem, was fully developed by Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney for the F135-PW-600.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney F135 is an afterburning turbofan developed for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine strike fighter. It has two variants; a Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant used in the F-35A and F-35C, and a two-cycle Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant used in the F-35B  that includes a forward lift fan. The first production engines were delivered in 2009.",
					"Developed from the Pratt & Whitney F119 engine used on the F-22 Raptor, the F135 produces around 28,000 lbf (125 kN) of thrust and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner. The F135 competed with the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 to power the F-35.",
					"The F135 originated with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with efforts to develop a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA program. Lockheed employee Paul Bevilaqua developed and patented a concept aircraft and propulsion system, and then turned to Pratt & Whitney (P&W) to build a demonstrator engine. The ground test demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The engine fan and core from the F100-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the \"F100-229-Plus\" demonstrator engine. This engine proved the lift-fan concept and led to the development of the current F135 engine.",
					"The F135 team is made up of Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Hamilton Sundstrand.  Pratt & Whitney is the prime contractor for the main engine, and systems integration.  Rolls-Royce is responsible for the vertical lift system for the STOVL aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is responsible for the electronic engine control system, actuation system, PMAG, gearbox, and health monitoring systems.  Woodward, Inc. is responsible for the fuel system.",
					"P&W developed the F135 from their F119 turbofan, which powers the F-22 Raptor, as the \"F119-JSF\". The F135 integrates the F119 core with new components optimized for the JSF.  The F135 is assembled at a plant in Middletown, Connecticut.  Some parts of the engine are made in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, and in Poland.",
					"The first production propulsion system for operational service was scheduled for delivery in 2007 with the purpose of serving the U.S., UK, and other international customers. The initial F-35s went into production with the F135 engines, but the GE/Rolls-Royce team planned to develop a replacement F136 engine in July 2009. In 2010, the Pentagon planned for the two propulsion systems to be competitively tendered. However, since 2006 the Defense Department has not requested funding for the alternate F136 engine program, but Congress has maintained program funding.",
					"As of 2009, P&W developed a more durable version of the F135 engine to increase the service life of key parts. The life expectancy of the parts was reduced because the hot sections of the engine (combustor and high-pressure turbine blades specifically) ran hotter than expected. The test engine is designated XTE68/LF1, and testing is expected to begin in 2010. This redesign has caused “substantial cost growth.”",
					"P&W expected to deliver the F135 below the cost of the F119, even though it was a more powerful engine. However, in February 2013 a cracked turbine blade was found during a scheduled inspection. The crack was caused by operating at high turbine temperatures for longer periods than usual. In December 2013 the hollow first stage fan blisk failed at 77% of its expected life during a ground test. It was to be replaced by a solid part adding 6 lb (2.7 kg) in weight. In 2013, a former P&W employee was caught attempting to ship \"numerous boxes\" of sensitive information about the F135 to Iran.",
					"Despite the troubles, the 100th engine was delivered in 2013. LRIP-6 was agreed in 2013 for $1.1 billion for 38 engines of various types, which helped to decrease the unit cost.",
					"Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher C. Bogdan, the executive officer of the F-35 program, has called out P&W for falling short on manufacturing quality of the engines and slow deliveries. His deputy director Rear Admiral Randy Mahr said that P&W stopped their cost-cutting efforts after \"they got the monopoly\". In 2013 the price of the F135 increased by $4.3 billion.",
					"In May 2014, Pratt & Whitney discovered conflicting documentation about the origin of titanium material used in some of its engines, including the F135. The company assessed that the uncertainty did not pose a risk to safety of flight but suspended engine deliveries as a result. Bogdan supported P&W's actions and said the problem was now with A&P Alloys, the supplier. The US Defense Contract Management Agency wrote in June 2014 that Pratt & Whitney's \"continued poor management of suppliers is a primary driver for the increased potential problem notifications.\" A&P Alloys stated that they stood behind their product even though they were not given access to the parts to do their own testing. Tracy Miner, an attorney with Boston-based Demeo LLP representing A&P Alloys said, \"it is blatantly unfair to destroy A&P’s business without allowing A&P access to the materials in question\"",
					"In July 2014 there was an uncontained failure of a fan rotor while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before the flight, flexing of the engine caused excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator initiating the impending failure. The rub caused a temperature of over 1,000 °C (1,900 °F), well beyond the material limit of 540 °C (1,000 °F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured a fuel tank and hot air mixing with fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.",
					"Pratt & Whitney managed to meet their 2015 production goals, but \"recurring manufacturing quality issues\" in turbine blades and electronic control systems required engines to be pulled from the fleet.",
					"Derived from the F119 engine, the F135 is a mixed-flow afterburning turbofan with a new fan and LP turbine.",
					"There are two F135 variants: the -100 and the -600 versions.  A -400 version is mentioned, similar to the -100, the main difference being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials. The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering. The engine and Rolls-Royce LiftSystem make up the Integrated Lift Fan Propulsion System (ILFPS).",
					"The vertical thrust for the STOVL version is obtained from a two-stage lift fan (about 46%) in front of the engine, a vectoring exhaust nozzle (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using fan air from the bypass duct (about 8%). These contributions to the total lift are based on thrust values of 18,680 lbf (83.1 kN), 18,680 lbf (83.1 kN) and 3,290 lbf (14.6 kN) respectively. Another source gives thrust values of 20,000 lbf (89 kN), 18,000 lbf (80 kN), and 3,900 lbf (17 kN) respectively.",
					"In this configuration most of the bypass flow is ducted to the wing nozzles, known as roll posts. Some is used for cooling the rear exhaust nozzle, known as the 3-bearing swivel duct nozzle (3BSD). At the same time an auxiliary inlet is opened on top of the aircraft to provide additional air to the engine with low distortion during the hover.",
					"The low pressure (LP) turbine drives the lift fan through a shaft extension on the front of the LP rotor and a clutch. The engine operates as a separate flow turbofan with a higher bypass ratio. The power to drive the fan—about 30,000 shp (22,000 kW)—is obtained from the LP turbine by increasing the hot nozzle area.",
					"A higher bypass ratio increases the thrust for the same engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F135 is providing vertical lift using the increased bypass ratio from the lift fan, the thrust augmentation is 50% with no increase in fuel flow. Thrust augmentation is 52% in conventional flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow.",

The F-35 can achieve a limited 100% throttle cruise without afterburners of Mach 1.2 for 150 miles (240 km; 130 nmi).",
					"Like the F119, the F135 has a stealthy augmentor where traditional spray bars and flameholders are replaced by thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). Afterburner fuel injectors are integrated into these vanes, which block line-of-sight of the turbines, contributing to aft-sector stealth. The axisymmetric nozzle consists of fifteen partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge. This creates shed vortices and reduces the infrared signature of the exhaust plume. The effectiveness is reportedly comparable to that of the F119's wedge nozzles, while being substantially more cost effective and lower maintenance.",
					"The engine uses thermoelectric-powered sensors to monitor turbine bearing health.",
					"Improving engine reliability and ease of maintenance is a major objective for the F135. The engine has fewer parts than similar engines, which improves reliability. All line-replaceable components (LRCs) can be removed and replaced with a set of six common hand tools. The F135's health management system is designed to provide real time data to maintainers on the ground. This allows them to troubleshoot problems and prepare replacement parts before the aircraft returns to base. According to Pratt & Whitney, this data may help drastically reduce troubleshooting and replacement time, as much as 94% over legacy engines.",
					"Although no service has issued a requirement for an upgraded engine, Pratt and Whitney is cooperating with the US Navy on a two-block improvement plan for the F135 engine. The goals of Block 1 are a 7–10% increase in thrust and a 5–7% lower fuel burn. The plans include better cooling technology for turbine blades; this would increase the longevity of the engine and substantially reduce maintenance costs. The goal of Block 2 is to work with the US Air Force's Adaptive Engine Transition Program, with the intention of introducing technology for an engine rated at 45,000 lb of thrust, to be used in a sixth-generation fighter.",
					"At the end of May 2017 Pratt and Whitney announced the F135 Growth Option 1 had finished testing and was available for production. The upgrade requires the changing of the power module on older engines and can be seamlessly inserted into future production engines at a minimal increase in unit cost and no impact to delivery schedule. The Growth Option 1 offers an improvement of 6–10% thrust across the F-35 flight envelope while also getting a 5–6% fuel burn reduction.",
					"In June 2018, United Technologies, parent company of P&W, announced Growth Option 2.0 to help provide increased power and thermal management system (PTMS) capacity, providing options for operators for instance if they are wishing to upgrade to heavier weapons.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney F401 (company designation JTF22) was an afterburning turbofan engine developed by Pratt & Whitney in tandem with the company's F100. The F401 was intended to power the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and Rockwell XFV-12, but the engine was canceled due to costs and development issues.",
					"In 1967, the United States Air Force and United States Navy issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX, the fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970. This engine program was called the Initial Engine Development Program (IEDP), and was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
					"The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program.  General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. At the end of the IEDP, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition, the McDonnell Douglas F-15. The engine was designated the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine. The Air Force would award Pratt & Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would use the engine in the planned F-14B and the Rockwell XFV-12 project, but would cut back and later cancel its order with the latter's failure, and chose to continue to use the Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14.",
					"The F401 was the naval variant of the F100 design, sharing its core design while having a larger fan for greater bypass ratio, cruise efficiency and static thrust. The turbomachinery layout is largely the same as the F100, with the exception of an additional compressor stage driven by the low-pressure spool. The F401 produced 14,871 lbf (66.15 kN) in max continuous power, 16,489 lbf (73.35 kN) in military power, and 28,096 lbf (124.98 kN) augmented (in afterburner). This engine was intended to replace the TF30 in the originally planned F-14B and a prototype was first flown in 1973. Due to costs and the reliability issues that dogged early F100s, the F401 was eventually cancelled in 1974; the F-14B designation would later be used for F-14s re-engined with the General Electric F110. The F401 was also used in the developmental XFV-12, as well as the proposed Convair Model 200, and the Vought Model 1600, a naval F-16 derivative.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney XA101 is an American adaptive cycle engine demonstrator being developed by Pratt & Whitney for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and form the basis for the propulsion system for the United States Air Force's sixth generation fighter program, the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).",
					"The three-stream adaptive cycle design can direct air to the bypass third stream for increased fuel efficiency and cooling or to the core and fan streams for additional thrust and performance. The 45,000 lbf (200 kN) thrust class engine is expected to be significantly more powerful and efficient than existing low-bypass turbofans.",
					"The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy began pursuing the adaptive cycle engine concept in 2007 with the Adaptive Versatile Engine Technology (ADVENT) program, a part of the larger Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) program. While not involved with ADVENT, Pratt & Whitney was selected alongside General Electric for the Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstrator (AETD) program that followed in 2012; this program continued to mature the technology, with tests performed using demonstrator engines. The next step, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), was launched in 2016 to develop adaptive engines for sixth-generation fighter propulsion as well as potential re-engining of the F-35 from the existing F135 turbofan engine. The General Electric demonstrator was designated XA100 and the P&W engine was designated XA101. The AETP goal was to demonstrate 25% improved fuel efficiency, 10% additional thrust, and improved thermal management. In 2017, Pratt & Whitney successfully tested an adaptive three-stream fan with an F135 core, and considered the XA101 to be \"Growth Option 2.0\" in its long-term development plan for the F135. Further contract awards and modifications from Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) in 2018 increased the focus on re-engining of the F-35; there has also been investigations on applying the technology in upgrades for F-15, F-16, and F-22 propulsion systems. In June 2018, Pratt & Whitney changed its development plan for the F135, and instead offered an adaptive three-stream fan as Growth Option 2.0 that is separate from the XA101, which would instead have a new engine core. In 2020, the F135 development plan shifted from \"Growth Options\" to \"Engine Enhancement Packages\" (EEP), while the three-stream XA101 is a new engine with potential re-engining for the F-35A. Ground testing of the XA101 began in September 2021.",
					"Also in September 2021, Pratt & Whitney publicly stated serious doubts about the cost effectiveness of AETP's future for the F-35, stating that the XA101 was \"always intended … to be a sixth-generation [powerplant for sixth-generation fighters].\" Jennifer Latka, Vice President of the F135 program, explained: “There’s a significant amount of risk that comes with brand-new technology, and that would require a tremendous amount of validation to be done. We’re saying, the AETP is not the right fit for the F-35.” Instead, Pratt & Whitney is proposing a \"drop-in\" enhanced engine package that would improve thrust and range by 10% while also offering a 50% improvement in thermal management. While this falls short of the AETP's goal of a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, Pratt & Whitney argues the savings would be worth it, estimating the cost of developing AETP for the F-35 at up to $40 Billion.  As of 2021, thermal management had been an ongoing issue for the F135, largely due to the increased sustainment and maintenance costs caused from heat damage by running the engines hotter in order to take full advantage of newer, more powerful sensors and electronics being integrated into Block 4+ F-35s. The sensors and electronics subsequently require additional cooling to take full advantage of the aircraft's capability.  GE had previously stated that one advantage of their AETP XA100 engine is its third airstream, which its officials say can be used to help cool the F-35’s electronics. Nonetheless, Latka urged an official review of the program's requirements, stating, “We need to crystallize on what the requirement is, and then we figure out what the most cost-effective solution is once we understand that requirement.\"",
					"The XA101 is a three-stream adaptive cycle engine that can adjust the bypass ratio and fan pressure to increase fuel efficiency or thrust, depending on the scenario. It does this by employing a third bypass stream around the entire engine, with the ability to modulate the portion of airflow into the engine core or through this third stream, to increase fuel economy and act as a heat sink for cooling. This capability enables greater use of the high-speed, low-altitude portion of the F-35 flight regime. The increased cooling and power generation also enables the potential employment of directed-energy weapons in the future. When additional thrust is needed, the air from the third stream can be directed into the core and fan streams for increased performance."

					"The Pratt & Whitney JT3D is an early turbofan aircraft engine derived from the Pratt & Whitney JT3C.  It was first run in 1958 and was first flown in 1959 under a B-45 Tornado test aircraft. Over 8,000 JT3Ds were produced between 1959 and 1985. Most JT3D engines still in service today are used on military aircraft, where the engine is referred to by its US military designation of TF33.",
					"Aware of the competition from the Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan, Pratt & Whitney decided to develop the JT3D turbofan from the JT3C turbojet for later deliveries of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, then nearing entry into service. A 2-stage fan replaced the first 3 stages of the 9-stage JT3C LP compressor. On the LP turbine, the second stage was enlarged and a third stage added.",
					"Unlike GE with the CJ805-23, Pratt & Whitney had not undertaken any transonic fan research prior to designing the JT3D, so they were unable to incorporate a single stage unit into the specification. Instead P&W designed a 2-stage unit based on some research they had done to support the J91 nuclear turbojet.",
					"On the Boeing 707 the JT3D fan nacelle was relatively short, whereas the Douglas DC-8 installation had a full-length fan cowl. Pratt & Whitney provided a kit whereby JT3Cs could be converted to the JT3D specification, and performance, during an overhaul.",
					"In 1959, important orders for the engine were the Boeing 707-120B and Boeing 720B when American Airlines ordered one 707 powered by JT3D turbofans and KLM ordered a JT3D-powered Douglas DC-8. Earlier 707s and DC-8s had been powered by the JT3C and JT4A turbojets, and the improved efficiency of the turbofan soon attracted the airlines. A JT3D-powered 707-123B and 720-023B (the suffix B was to indicate a turbofan-powered aircraft) entered service with American Airlines on the same day, March 12, 1961.",
					"The Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers were all originally powered by turbojet engines. With the demise of many airline 707s, the United States Air Force took the opportunity to buy the surplus airframes and use the engines to re-fit the KC-135As used by the Air National Guard and reserve squadrons with the civilian JT3D (designated TF33-PW-102). Over 150 aircraft were modified and the former KC-135A was re-designated the KC-135E.",
					"After long service for both airlines and air forces, the number of JT3D-powered aircraft is steadily decreasing. One hundred thirty five KC-135s use the JT3D, while 354 were fitted with CFM International CFM56 engines, which provide greater thrust, lower fuel consumption, and increased operational flexibility due to their lower noise footprint. The noise of the JT3D is one of the reasons NATO has debated re-fitting their E-3 Sentry AWACS fleet, since the aircraft are subject to restrictions that aircraft with modern engines are not. Operational flexibility would be further increased due to the ability of higher power engines to increase the ceiling of the aircraft, extending the horizon for radar surveillance; for instance, RAF, French and Saudi E-3s routinely fly higher than NATO/USAF counterparts.",
					"In 1961, the TF33-powered Boeing B-52H Stratofortress entered service. The \"H\" model of the B-52 was the only production variant of the heavy bomber to be fitted with turbofan engines, and is the only model remaining in United States Air Force service. It is expected to remain as a mainstay of the Air Force heavy bomber fleet until at least 2040, with options for replacing the 8 TF33 engines with more modern equivalents being considered. In April 2020, the USAF released a request for proposals for 608 commercial replacement engines, with the plan to award the contract in May 2021. In September 2021, the USAF announced that the TF33 would be replaced by the Rolls-Royce F130.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney TF30 (company designation JTF10A) is a military low-bypass turbofan engine originally designed by Pratt & Whitney for the subsonic F6D Missileer fleet defense fighter, but this project was cancelled. It was later adapted with an afterburner for supersonic designs, and in this form it was the world's first production afterburning turbofan, going on to power the F-111 and the F-14A Tomcat, as well as being used in early versions of the A-7 Corsair II without an afterburner. First flight of the TF30 was in 1964 and production continued until 1986.",
					"In 1958, the Douglas Aircraft Company proposed a short-range, four-engined jet airliner to fill the gap below its new DC-8 intercontinental, known internally as the Model 2067. Intended to be marketed as  DC-9, it was not directly related to the later twin-engined Douglas DC-9. Pratt & Whitney (P&W) had offered its JT8A turbojet for the airliner, but Douglas preferred to go with a turbofan engine, which would have a greater fuel efficiency than a turbojet. P&W then proposed the JT10A, a half-scale version of its newly developed JT8D turbofan. Development of the new design began in April 1959, using the core of the JT8. Douglas shelved the model 2067 design in 1960, as the targeted US airlines preferred the newly offered Boeing 727.",
					"In 1960, the United States Navy selected the JT10A, designated TF30-P-1, to power the proposed Douglas F6D Missileer, but the project was canceled in April 1961. Meanwhile, the TF30 had been chosen by General Dynamics for its entrant in the TFX competition for the United States Air Force and USN, which was selected for production as the F-111. The version of the TF30 for the F-111 included an afterburner.",
					"The F-111A, EF-111A and F-111E used the TF30-P-3 turbofan. The F-111 had problems with inlet compatibility, and many faulted the placement of the intakes behind the disturbed air of the wing.  Newer F-111 variants incorporated improved intake designs and most variants featured more powerful versions of the TF30 engine.  The F-111E was updated to use TF30-P-103 engines, the F-111D included the TF30-P-9/109, the FB-111A used the TF-30-P-7/107, and the F-111F had the TF30-P-100. ",
					"RAAF F-111Cs were upgraded with the unique P-108 version, using a P-109 engine mated to a P-107 afterburner. The F-111 Engine Business Unit (later taken over by TAE) at RAAF Base Amberley became the world experts on the TF-30 in the years after the USAF retired their fleet and achieved extraordinary increases reliability of the TF-30. ",
					"The TF30 proved itself to be well-suited to the requirements of a high-speed low-altitude strike aircraft with a relatively long operational range, and F-111s in all guises would continue to use TF30s until their retirement.",
					"In 1964, the subsonic LTV A-7A Corsair II won the US Navy's VAL competition for a light attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. The A-7A used a non-afterburning variant of the TF30, which would also power the improved A-7B and A-7C.  In 1965, the USAF selected the A-7D as a replacement for its fast-jet F-100 and F-105 supersonic fighter-bombers in the close air support role. Though the USAF had wanted the TF30, Pratt & Whitney was unable to meet the production timetable, because its facilities were already committed to producing other engines. Instead of producing the TF30 under license for P&W, the Allison Engine Company offered to the Air Force its TF41 turbofan, a license-built version of the RB.168-25R Spey.  The USAF selected the more powerful TF41 for the A-7D, as did the USN, for its similar A-7E.",
					"The Grumman F-14 Tomcat with the TF30-P-414A was underpowered, because it was the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of 1 or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon).  However, due to the intent to incorporate as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant.  The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however, the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA), if the pilot moved the throttles aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.",
					"The F-14's problems did not afflict TF30 engines in the USAF and RAAF F-111s to nearly the same extent. The F-111, while technically designated as a \"fighter,\" was actually used as a ground attack aircraft and tactical bomber. A typical ground strike mission is characterized by less abrupt changes in throttle, angle of attack and altitude than an air-to-air combat mission. While it can still involve hard and violent maneuvers to avoid enemy missiles and aircraft, these maneuvers are generally still not nearly as hard and violent as those required in air-to-air combat, and the F-111 is a larger and less-maneuverable aircraft. Though the F-14A entered service with the Navy powered by the Pratt & Whitney TF30, by the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine, the Department of Defense began procuring F110-GE-400 engines and installed them in the F-14A Plus (later redesignated to F-14B in 1991), which entered service with the fleet in 1988. These engines solved the reliability problems and provided nearly 30% more thrust, achieving a 1:1 dry thrust to weight ratio with a low fuel load.  The subsequent F-14D, a combination of both remanufactured/upgraded F-14As and new manufacture F-14Ds, also used F110-GE-400 engines.",

The single-rotation propeller had four hollow steel blades, a maximum blade chord of 22 inches (56 centimeters), a length of 5 ft 6 in (1.7 m), and a weight of 3,600 pounds (1,600 kilograms).",
					"In the late 1950s, the XT57 was studied for use in a United States Navy-proposed, nuclear-powered conversion of a Saunders-Roe Princess flying boat. Despite not having entered service, the engine was selected because it had passed a Pratt & Whitney 150-hour testing program, which involved running the engine for 5,000–7,000 hours.",
					"The XT57 engine is on display at the Pratt & Whitney museum in East Hartford, Connecticut."

				"data": [
					"The Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX was an experimental aircraft engine, a hybrid between a turbofan and a turboprop known as a propfan. The engine was designed in the 1980s to power proposed propfan aircraft such as the Boeing 7J7 and the MD-91 and MD-92 derivatives of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80. As of 2019, it is still one of only four different contra-rotating propfan engines to have flown in service or in flight testing.",
					"The Allison Engine Company, a division of automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM), unveiled its Model 578 contra-rotating propfan engine at the Paris Air Show in mid-1985. The engine represented Allison's attempt to re-enter the commercial airline engine market, because after turboprop aircraft were overtaken in civil aviation in the 1950s and 1960s, Allison was mostly confined to selling military aircraft engines. Targeted to power passenger airliners seating between 100 and 160 passengers, the engine would be based on the core of the Allison T701 heavy lift helicopter turboshaft engine, which first ran in 1975. The engine would come in two sizes: a 10,000 shaft horsepower (7,500 kilowatts) variant with a 23:1 compression ratio and a three-stage boost compressor and power turbine added to the T701 core, and a 16,000 shaft hp (12,000 kW) variant with a 33:1 pressure ratio and a four-stage boost and power section. Since Allison estimated that a 100-seat plane required two 9,000–10,000 shaft hp (6,700–7,500 kW) engines and that a 150-seat plane needed two 13,000–15,000 shaft hp (9,700–11,200 kW) engines, the two sizes chosen should handle the 100-160 passenger aircraft market. Allison hoped to have its 578 engine ready for flight tests in late 1987.",
					"Allison and United Technologies aircraft engine division Pratt & Whitney announced on March 14, 1986 that they would develop the engine as a joint venture. The agreement, which was signed on February 25, was reached because Pratt & Whitney would not be able to develop its own propfan engine by the planned 1992 certification date of the 7J7, and because it also did not have an engine core in the size range of 10,000–16,000 shaft hp (7,500–11,900 kW). Allison would develop the engine and perform ground testing, while Pratt & Whitney would integrate the propulsion system into the aircraft and manage the flight test program.",
					"On February 23, 1987 in Detroit, Michigan, Pratt & Whitney and Allison officially formed a joint company named PW–Allison Engines. The new company claimed that compared a commercial jet engine, its propfan engines would consume 30-percent less fuel, require shorter runway lengths during takeoffs and landings, and be quieter (because of the slower propfan rotational speeds enabled by the 578's gearbox). The partnership would last 20 years and cover geared propfan development in the 8,200–16,000 shaft hp (6,100–11,900 kW) range, though the power range could be increased by fifteen percent with a specific mechanical modification. The new company also expected Japanese and European engine makers to eventually join its program instead of creating competing propfan engines. PW–Allison Engines was to invest at least 500 million dollars to bring the engine into commercial production (depending on airline commitments to buy aircraft using its engines), and it assumed that the new company would take half of the market for new medium-sized airliners over the next ten years—a 13-to-18 billion dollar market, it estimated. Pratt & Whitney would handle the marketing to commercial customers, while Allison would do the marketing to military customers. Other members of the new company included GM subsidiaries Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics and United Technologies subsidiary Hamilton Standard, the propeller manufacturer that invented the propfan concept with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s.",
					"On December 20, 1985, Boeing and Allison agreed to test its new propfan engine for use on the Boeing 7J7. As of early 1986, Allison maintained that it could have its propfan engine certified by early 1990, although a few months later the company changed the certification target timeline to 1992. By early/mid 1987, Boeing had rejected using the PW–Allison engine for its 7J7. Although Boeing had not tested PW–Allison's propfan in flight, the airframer said that the PW–Allison engine's off-the-shelf core was not powerful enough to power the 150-seat plane. PW–Allison vigorously objected, claiming its engine's gearbox could handle 13,000 shaft hp (9,700 kW), the agreement between Pratt & Whitney and Allison covered up to 16,000 shaft hp (12,000 kW), and the gearbox design could go to 25,000 shaft hp (19,000 kW). The decision became moot in December 1987, when Boeing indefinitely suspended development of the 7J7 aircraft, four months after delaying the 7J7 availability date from 1992 to 1993.",
					"In January 1986, Allison also signed a memorandum of understanding with McDonnell Douglas to perform flight tests on the Allison demonstrator engine, now known as the 578-DX, on an MD-80 testbed in late 1987. The flight test program was in preparation for McDonnell Douglas's ultra-high bypass (UHB) MD-91X derivative, a 114-seat airliner that had a planned service entry in the early 1990s. The demonstrator engine would convert 10,400 shaft hp (7,800 kW) into 19,000 pounds-force (85 kilonewtons) of thrust. One engine would be built for ground testing, while another would be used in flight tests. The 578-DX would follow in testing the competing General Electric GE36 UDF engine, which was scheduled for 75 hours of flight tests on the MD-80 testbed from May 1987 through August 1987; the 578-DX would complete its 75 hours of flight testing from December 1987 through February 1988. During the middle of each engine's test program, McDonnell Douglas would let airline representatives fly in the testbed aircraft to assess the passenger experience. McDonnell Douglas would begin installing one 578-DX demonstrator on its testbed in September 1987, while PW-Allison would perform ground tests with its other 578-DX demonstrator from mid-June 1987 to November 1987. Ground testing was to begin around August 1987, and PW–Allison was confident that its engine would be flight tested by early December.",
					"A number of issues hindered the 578-DX, though. First, there was difficulty in manufacturing the thin, swept blades. Then, after one test engine was disassembled for inspection, the second engine ingested parts of the first engine into its compressor during testing. These problems delayed flight tests until the end of February 1988, and they delayed ground testing of the engine until December 19, 1987. In February 1988, PW–Allison postponed the service entry date until the end of 1993 at the earliest, as it said that the 578-DX was not powerful enough for the MD-92, and the required increase in engine power from 14,000 to 16,000 shaft hp (10,000 to 12,000 kW) could not be finished in time for the McDonnell Douglas's 1992 target date. PW–Allison moved the beginning of flight tests to May 1988, but the flight date target was missed again because of endurance problems from the electrical pitch-change motors, so flight testing was put off until August to October of 1988.",
					"Amidst the flight test delays, McDonnell Douglas repeatedly expressed dismay that PW–Allison had not made a formal offer to place its engines into an MD-90 production program. The airframer wanted to offer its proposed derivatives to airlines with a choice of powerplant options, instead of advertising aircraft availability with just the competing GE36 UDF engine. However, PW–Allison refused to submit an offering to McDonnell Douglas and the airlines before its flight tests were completed and evaluated.",
					"Ground tests for the 578-DX finished on August 10, 1988 after almost 2,500 hours of runs, resulting in a successful preliminary flight rating test (PFRT), which cleared the way for flight testing. However, the 578-DX could not undergo flight tests until early 1989, because the GE36 demonstrator had been reinstalled on the MD-80 testbed for additional tests. The 578-DX was shipped off for testbed installation on October 18, 1988, and it was installed on the MD-80 testbed in November 1988. The testbed then performed ground runs and taxi tests at Edwards Air Force Base, with the first flight scheduled for January 1989. More delays occurred, though, including one during preparation for a planned March 12, 1989 first flight that was caused by an abrasion on the gearbox's bearing separator.",
					"Nearly a year and a half after the flight test was originally planned, the 578-DX engine finally flew on April 13, 1989, with the first five flights being described as performing \"flawlessly\" through nearly the whole flight envelope. At the time, the 578-DX demonstration program was planning to conduct 50 hours of flight tests over the upcoming three to four months. The demonstrator covered a flight envelope of up to Mach 0.77 and up to an altitude of 30,000 ft (9,100 m), with one flight attaining an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 340 knots (390 mph; 630 km/h) at an altitude of 22,000 feet (6,700 m), or over Mach 0.8. However, the 578-DX testbed aircraft ended up flying only through May 1989, making 14 test flights for a total of just 20 hours.",
					"Due to the absence of firm propfan orders, McDonnell Douglas announced in May 1989 that the V2500 turbofan engine from International Aero Engines (a multinational engine consortium that included Pratt & Whitney as a member) would be provided as a powerplant option for the MD-90 series. In September 1989, with the order drought continuing, McDonnell Douglas decided to offer the MD-90 series exclusively with the V2500 turbofan engine, ending the airliner sales prospects for the PW–Allison 578-DX propfan. Allison acknowledged that the higher price of its propfan, which some estimated to have a cost of US$4 million (or 40 percent higher than existing turbofan engines), would be unattractive to airline customers at the low fuel prices of the time. It also said that it would not perform any more flight tests of its propfan, preferring to study the data from the flight tests previously done on the MD-80.",
					"Allison's engine was also being examined by the military for airlift and reconnaissance aircraft, and it was offered unsuccessfully for some military aircraft applications. As of early 1988, the Allison 578-D engine was the base powerplant for the Future International Military/Civil Airlifter (FIMA) consortium, which intended to build a replacement military transport aircraft for the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the French-German Transall C-160 for American and western European military airfleets. The FIMA engine would be smaller than the demonstrator engine, as its contra-rotating propellers would have only four blades in front and four blades in back, and it would generate 8,800 hp (6,600 kW). The aircraft would fly at Mach 0.72 and operate from 2,000 to 3,000 ft (610 to 910 m) runway strips.",
					"The propfan engine had 11.6 ft diameter (3.5 m; 139 in; 350 cm) coaxial contra-rotating propellers, with the front and back propellers (supplied by Hamilton Standard) each containing six blades of 4.35 ft (1.33 m; 52.2 in; 133 cm) in length. The propellers had a recommended tip speed of 750 feet per second (230 metres per second; 510 miles per hour; 820 kilometres per hour), and the engine could support a maximum aircraft flight speed of Mach 0.80–0.82. 44 percent of the engine's torque would be handled by the front propeller, while the other 56 percent would be absorbed by the back propeller. The hot gas exhaust contributes just two to three percent of the total thrust. The 578-DX engine was longer and thinner than the competing GE36 UDF engine.",
					"The design adopted many aspects of the Allison 501-M78 single-rotation propfan engine, a single-rotation, 9 ft diameter (2.7 m; 110 in; 270 cm) powerplant being prepared for flight testing on a Gulfstream II business jet. The 501-M78 was an experimental engine that Allison was developing since 1984 as part of the NASA Propfan Test Assessment (PTA). It was a variant of the Allison T701 heavy lift helicopter turboshaft engine, which produced 8,079 shp (6,025 kW) and was also known as the Allison 501-M62B. The T701 was to power the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 helicopter, but after the XCH-62 was abandoned, the engine technology was redirected in 1976 toward an industrial gas turbine, which debuted in 1979 as the Allison 570-K. The 578-DX was derived from the Allison 571, a variant of the Allison 570 that entered service in 1985. There was much commonality in the participants of both engines: in addition to Allison supplying both of the engine cores, the PTA engine also used propellers designed by Hamilton Standard, and both the 501-M78 and the 578-DX had nacelles built by Rohr Industries. This arrangement facilitated the technology transfer from the 501-M78 to the 578-DX. In addition, the blades and the coaxial propellers on the 578-DX were inspired by the SR-7 single-rotation fan on the 501-M78 and the NASA-studied CRP-X1, a 2 ft contra-rotating (0.61 m; 24 in; 61 cm) model propfan with a 5x5 blade configuration.",
					"Unlike the GE36, the 578-DX was fairly conventional, having a reduction gearbox between the low-pressure turbine and the propfan blades, which was thought to give a fuel efficiency advantage of seven percent against the GE36, according to McDonnell Douglas. Allison, which developed the gearbox, claimed a fuel savings of ten percent and the elimination of 1,000 turbine blades. The demonstrator engines produced 10,400 horsepower (7,800 kilowatts), generating a thrust of 21,000 pounds-force (93 kilonewtons). The gearbox would have a reduction ratio of 8.33 to 1, and it would be in service to an airline for 30,000 flight hours (ten years) before requiring a major overhaul, which bettered the mean time between removals (MTBR) of 8,000 flight hours for the Allison T56 turboprop, Allison's top-performing gearbox. The new gearbox, which the propfan developers said had only 15 major parts and was technologically simple, would provide accessory access without having to remove the engine or gearbox, since half of the removals on the T56 historically were caused by failures of accessories. Instead of the six accessory drives used on the T56, the PW-Allison propfan would have no more than two accessory drives. The design was also aided by a study funded by NASA and Allison to develop a 13,000 shaft hp (9,700 kW) contra-rotating gearbox.",
					"Pratt & Whitney and Allison planned to offer their propfan in three different production models: the 578-D, which produced 11,800 hp (8,800 kW), climbed at an overall pressure ratio (OPR) of 23.4, and had a combustor exit temperature (CET) of 2,230 °F (1,220 °C; 2,690 °R; 1,490 K); the 578-E, a 13,500 hp (10,100 kW) model with a climb OPR of 31.3 and a CET of 2,390 °F (1,310 °C; 2,850 °R; 1,580 K); and the 578-F, the most powerful engine at 16,000 hp (12,000 kW), climbing at OPR 31.3 and with a CET of 2,535 °F (1,391 °C; 2,995 °R; 1,664 K). The 578-DX demonstrator engine did not completely reflect the design of the planned production models. For example, the 578-DX expels its hot exhaust gases forward of the propfan blades, initially requiring the use of heat-resistant blade materials to withstand the 500 °F (260 °C) exhaust stream, but the production engine design was modified to release the gases at the back of the engine to prevent the blades from heating up.",

In 2017, the company reported that in 2014 they had 38,737 employees supporting more than 11,000 customers in 180 countries around the world. In 2013, Pratt & Whitney's revenue totaled $14.5 billion.",
					"In April 1925, Frederick Rentschler, an Ohio native and former executive at Wright Aeronautical, was determined to start an aviation-related business of his own. His social network included Edward Deeds, another prominent Ohioan of the early aviation industry, and Frederick's brother Gordon Rentschler, both of whom were on the board of Niles Bement Pond, then one of the largest machine tool corporations in the world. Frederick Rentschler approached these men as he sought capital and assets for his new venture. Deeds and G. Rentschler persuaded the board of Niles Bement Pond that their Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool (P&WMT) subsidiary of Hartford, Connecticut, should provide the funding and location to build a new aircraft engine being developed by Rentschler, George J. Mead, and colleagues, all formerly of Wright Aeronautical. Conceived and designed by Mead, the new engine would be a large, air-cooled, radial design. Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool was going through a period of self-revision at the time to prepare itself for the post-World War I era, discontinuing old product lines and incubating new ones. World War I had been profitable to P&WMT, but the peace brought a predictable glut to the machine tool market, as contracts with governments were canceled and the market in used, recently built tools competed against new ones. P&WMT's future growth would depend on innovation. Having idle factory space and capital available at this historical moment, to be invested wherever good return seemed available, P&WMT saw the post-war aviation industry, both military and civil (commercial, private), as one with some of the greatest growth and development potential available anywhere for the next few decades. It lent Rentschler US$250,000, the use of the Pratt & Whitney name, and space in their building. This was the beginning of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company. Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's first engine, the 425 horsepower (317 kW) R-1340 Wasp, was completed on Christmas Eve 1925. On its third test run it easily passed the U.S. Navy qualification test in March 1926; by October 1926, the U.S. Navy had ordered 200. The Wasp exhibited performance and reliability that revolutionized American aviation. The R-1340 powered the aircraft of Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, and many other record flights.",
					"The R-1340 was followed by another very successful engine, the R-985 Wasp Junior. Eventually a whole Wasp series was developed. Both engines are still in use in agricultural aircraft around the world and produce more power than their original design criteria.",
					"George Mead soon led the next step in the field of large, state-of-the-art, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines (which the Wasp dominated) when Pratt & Whitney released its R-1690 Hornet. It was basically \"a bigger Wasp\".",
					"In 1929, Rentschler ended his association with Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool and merged Pratt & Whitney Aircraft with Boeing and other companies to form the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC). His agreement allowed him to carry the Pratt & Whitney name with him to his new corporation. Only five years later, in 1934, the federal government of U.S. banned common ownership of airplane manufacturers and airlines. Pratt & Whitney was merged with UATC's other manufacturing interests east of the Mississippi River as United Aircraft Corporation, with Rentschler as president. In 1975, United Aircraft Corporation became United Technologies.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney F100 (company designation JTF22) is an afterburning turbofan engine designed and manufactured by Pratt & Whitney to power the U.S. Air Force's \"FX\" initiated in 1965, which became the F-15 Eagle. The engine was to be developed in tandem with the F401 which shares a similar core but with the fan upscaled for the U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat, although the F401 was later abandoned due to costs and reliability issues. The F100 would also power the F-16 Fighting Falcon for the Air Force's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program.",
					"In 1967, the United States Navy and United States Air Force issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX, which became the parallel fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970. This engine program was called the IEDP (Initial Engine Development Program) and was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB. Under ASD, a Systems Project Office Cadre was assigned to manage both the FX Aircraft and Engine definition phase. The Turbine Engine Division of the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory was employed in a support role to assist ASD Systems Engineering in evaluations of technical risks. Later upon selection of the F-15 the ASD engineering cadre became the F-15 Systems Project Office.",
					"The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program.  General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.  At the end of the IEDP, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition, the McDonnell Douglas F-15. The Pratt & Whitney proposal was selected as the winner and the engine was designated the F100. The Air Force would award Pratt & Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would use the engine in the planned F-14B and the XFV-12 project but would cut back and later cancel its order after the latter's failure due to costs and reliability issues, and chose to continue to use the Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14s.",
					"The F100 is a twin spool, axial flow, afterburning turbofan engine. It has a 3-stage fan driven by a two-stage low-pressure turbine and a 10-stage compressor driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine. The initial F100-PW-100 variant generates nearly 24,000 lbf (107 kN) of thrust in full afterburner and weighs approximately 3,000 lb (1,361 kg), achieving its target thrust-to-weight ratio of 8 and providing the F-15 with its desired thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 1:1 at combat weight.",
					"The F100-PW-100 first flew in an F-15 Eagle in 1972 with a maximum continuous power rating of 12,410 lbf (55.2 kN), military power of 14,690 lbf (65.3 kN), and afterburning thrust of 23,930 lbf (106.4 kN) with 5-minute limit. Due to the advanced nature of engine stemming from ambitious performance goals, numerous problems were encountered in its early days of service including high wear, stalling and \"hard\" afterburner starts. These \"hard\" starts could be caused by failure of the afterburner to start or by extinguishing after start, in either case the large jets of jet fuel were lit by the engine exhaust resulting in high pressure waves causing the engine to stall; these stagnation stalls usually occurred at high Mach and high altitude, and could seriously damage the turbine if the condition was not corrected. The problems were contributed by pilots making much more abrupt throttle changes than previous fighters and engines due to the excess thrust available. Early problems were eventually solved by the development of the F100-PW-220 in the early 1980s, which the -100 could be upgraded to.",
					"The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered service with the F100-PW-200; compared to the -100, the -200 has some additional redundancies for single-engine reliability and almost identical thrust ratings. In particular, a \"proximate splitter\" was introduced on the -200 that reduced the severity of the high pressure waves from \"hard\" afterburner starts. This greatly reduced the rate of stagnation stalls, and the -200 on the F-16 saw much better reliability than the -100 on the F-15, although some of the issues from the -100 remained. Similarly, these problems were eventually solved by the F100-PW-220, which the -200 could be upgraded to as well.",
					"Due to the unsatisfactory reliability, maintenance costs, and service life of the F100-100/200, Pratt & Whitney was eventually pressured into upgrading the engine to address these issues. The Air Force also began funding the General Electric F101 Derivative Fighter Engine, which eventually became the F110, as a competitor to the F100 to coerce more urgency from Pratt & Whitney. The result of Pratt & Whitney's improvement efforts was the F100-PW-220, which eliminates almost all stall-stagnations and augmentor instability issues from the -100 as well as doubling time between depot overhauls. Reliability and maintenance costs were also drastically improved, and the engine incorporates a digital electronic engine control (DEEC). The -220 engine produces static thrust of 14,590 lbf (64.9 kN) in military (intermediate) power and 23,770 lbf (105.7 kN) afterburning, very slightly lower than the static thrust of the -100/200, but the -220 has better dynamic thrust across most of the envelope.",
					"The F100-220 was introduced in 1986 and was installed on the F-15 or F-16, gradually replacing the -100/200. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down, the USAF implemented the Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984 (nicknamed \"The Great Engine War\"), under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition; the -220 would be Pratt & Whitney's initial offering in the AFE program, competing with the General Electric F110-GE-100. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with the common engine bay, able to accept the existing F100-200/220 engine (Block 32) or the F110-100 (Block 30). A non-afterburning variant, the F100-PW-220U powers the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV. The -100 and -200 series engines could be upgraded to become equivalent to -220 specifications; the \"E\" abbreviation from 220E is for \"equivalent\" and given to engines which have been upgraded as such.",
					"The F100-PW-229 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-129, were the result of the USAF seeking greater power for its tactical aircraft through the Improved Performance Engine (IPE) program in the 1980s. It was developed under company designation PW1128; in addition to greater thrust, the -229 incorporates the reliability and durability improvements of the -220 as well as an enhanced DEEC. Compared to earlier variants, the -229 has a higher turbine inlet temperature, higher airflow of 248 lb/s (112 kg/s), and lower bypass ratio. The first engine was flown in 1989 and produced thrust of 17,800 lbf (79.2 kN) (dry/intermediate thrust) and 29,160 lbf (129.7 kN) with afterburner. The -229 powers late model F-16C/D Block 52s and F-15Es.",
					"A variant of the -229 fitted with a 3-dimensional axisymmetric thrust vectoring nozzle, referred by Pratt & Whitney as the Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzle (P/YBBN), was tested on the F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles) in the 1990s.",
					"In 2007, the F100-PW-229EEP (Engine Enhancement Package) began development to increase reliability and number of accumulated cycles between depot overhauls. This was done by applying technology from the F100-PW-232 (see below), which in turn incorporated technology and advancements from the F119 program for the F-22, as well as (for -229EEP) from the F135 program for the F-35; the -229EEP incorporates updated turbine materials, cooling management techniques, compressor aerodynamics, split cases (top and bottom) and updated DEEC software. Deliveries of the -229EEP began in 2009.",
					"The F100-PW-232, originally called F100-PW-229A (Advanced), was a further enhanced variant that incorporated engineering advances and technology from Pratt & Whitney's F119 engine for the F-22 as well as operational experience from the -229; development began in the late 1990s. Both the -232 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-132, were designed to make full use of the F-16's Modular Common Inlet Duct (MCID), or \"Big Mouth\" inlet introduced in the Block 30 variant. The fan was larger for increased airflow of 275 lb/s (125 kg/s) and redesigned to be more reliable; it incorporated stages with the blades and disk formed into a single piece called an integrally-blades rotor (IBR), or blisk. The stators were also redesigned for better aerodynamics to improve stall margin. The -232 could produce 20,100 lbf (89.4 kN) of thrust in intermediate power and 32,500 lbf (144.6 kN) in afterburner; alternatively it could produce the same thrust levels as the -229 but increase inspection intervals by 40%. The -232 was not pursued by the USAF, but many of the improvements were incorporated into the -229EEP to increase its reliability and inspection intervals.",
					"The F401 was the naval development of the F100 and designed in tandem. It was intended to power the F-14B Tomcat and Rockwell XFV-12, but the engine was canceled due to costs and development issues. The PW1120 turbofan was a smaller derivative of the F100; it was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney F119, company designation PW5000, is an afterburning turbofan engine developed by Pratt & Whitney for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, which resulted in the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The engine delivers thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class and was designed for sustained supersonic flight without afterburners, or supercruise. Delivering almost 22% more thrust with 40% fewer parts than its F100 predecessor, the F119 allows the F-22 to achieve supercruise speeds of up to Mach 1.8. The F119's nozzles incorporate thrust vectoring that enable them to direct the engine thrust ±20° in the pitch axis to give the F-22 enhanced maneuverability.",
					"The F119 is also the basis for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion system, with variants powering both the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrators. The X-35 won the JSF competition and the production Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is powered by an F119 derivative, the Pratt & Whitney F135 which produces up to 43,000 lbf (191 kN) of thrust.",
					"The F119 resulted from the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). Detailed design of Pratt & Whitney's submission, designated internally as PW5000, began when the request for proposals (RFP) for JAFE, later renamed ATF Engine, was released in May 1983. Advances in engine technology, such as those from the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) and the Joint Technology Demonstration Engine (JTDE) programs, allowed the design to do more work with fewer stages, with the PW5000's compressor having only 6 stages compared to the 10 stages in the F100's compressor. The high pressure and low pressure turbines were single stage and counter-rotating, which reduced the gyroscopic forces on the engine; it was hoped that counter-rotation would eliminate a row of turbine stators, which would save weight and reduce parts count, but this was ultimately not successful and the stators were retained. The fan and compressor stages were to use integrally bladed rotors (IBR), also known as blisks, to reduce weight and cost and improve performance. Owing to the ATF's demanding requirements for supercruise, the PW5000 design has low bypass ratio, high core and turbine inlet temperatures, and a fully variable convergent-divergent nozzle to achieve high specific thrust in intermediate, or non-afterburning power. The combustor, internally named Floatwall, eliminated welds to mitigate crack growth due to thermal cycling. The original RFP called for maximum thrust in the 30,000 lbf (133 kN) class for an aircraft gross weight of 50,000 lb (22,700 kg).",
					"Pratt & Whitney and General Electric were selected to make prototype engines, designated YF119 and YF120 respectively, for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val). Both engine makers would provide engines for both the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 and the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 ATF technology and flight demonstrators. The ATF's increasing weight during development required more thrust to meet the performance requirements; as gross weight grew to 60,000 lb (27,200 kg), the required maximum thrust was increased by 20% to 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. Pratt & Whitney's design changed to incorporate a 15% larger fan, increasing bypass ratio from 0.25 to 0.30. However, unlike General Electric, Pratt & Whitney did not fit its larger fan on flightworthy YF119s for the ATF flight demonstrators to avoid potential reliability issues that may arise. Instead, the revised fan was extensively ground tested at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. As a result, both the YF-22 and YF-23 had lower performance with the YF119s than with the YF120s.",
					"On 3 August 1991, Pratt & Whitney was awarded the EMD contract for ATF engine, while the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics team won the contract for the ATF airframe. While the YF119 was a more conventional design compared to the General Electric's variable cycle YF120, Pratt & Whitney accrued far greater test hours and emphasized reliability and the lower risk. Ground tests of the F119-PW-100 were first conducted in February 1993. The production engines were fitted on the production F-22, and were first flown on the F-22's maiden flight on 7 September 1997. A total of 507 engines were produced. In 2013 Pratt & Whitney assisted the F119 Heavy Maintenance Center (HMC) at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma in the first F119 depot overhaul.",
					"Turbine engine advances from ATEGG and JTDE continued with the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, with applications in F119 improvement packages and derivatives. Prototype YF119 variants powered the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) concept demonstrator aircraft, and subsequent full scale development of the F119 derivative resulted in the F135 family of engines that powers the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.",
					"The F119 is a twin-spool axial-flow low-bypass turbofan. It has a three-stage fan driven by a single-stage low pressure turbine and six-stage high pressure compressor driven by single-stage high pressure turbine. The shroud-less fan has wide-chord, low aspect ratio hollow titanium fan blades that are linear-friction welded to the disks to form single-piece integrally-bladed rotors (IBRs), or blisks. The compressor stators and thrust-vectoring nozzle use a burn-resistant titanium alloy called Alloy C, with the first row of vanes variable in order to increase surge margin. The Floatwall annular combustor is lined with high-cobalt material for oxidation resistance and combustion chamber durability, and ensures the clean burning of the fuel and reduced NOx generation. The high-pressure turbine blades are made of single-crystal superalloys and impingement cooled using air from the high-pressure compressor. The high and low pressure spools are counter-rotating. The requirement for the ATF to supercruise, or fly supersonic without afterburners, results in a very low bypass ratio of 0.30 for the F119-PW-100 in order to achieve high specific thrust. The F119 has dual-redundant full authority digital engine control (FADEC), also referred to internally as Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), supplied by Hamilton Standard and fully integrated into the F-22's vehicle management system.",
					"The three-zone afterburner, or augmentor, contributes to the stealth of the aircraft by having fuel injectors integrated into thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). These vanes replace the traditional fuel spray bars and flame holders and block line-of-sight of the turbines. The convergent-divergent nozzle can vector ±20° in the pitch axis, which greatly improves the aircraft's pitch authority by augmenting the pitching moment of the tail with engine thrust; this enables the F-22 to remain controllable while flying at a trimmed alpha of over 60°. The thrust vectoring is fully integrated into the F-22's flight control system to facilitate handling. The rectangular nozzle consists two wedge-shaped flaps for stealth and also contribute to lower infrared signature by flattening the exhaust plume and facilitating its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices.",
					"The F119 has a design life of 8,650 total accumulated cycles, with overhaul of the hot section approximately every 2,000 hours and the cold section every 4,000 hours.",
					"While the production F119 on the F-22 incorporates rectangular thrust vectoring nozzles, prototype variants on other aircraft had different nozzle solutions that are tailored to the airframe.",
					"The YF119 on the YF-23 had a single-expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) consisting of a variable wedge flap on the top and a fixed ramp on the bottom, which then transitions to a trench on top of the aft fuselage. While the SERN lacked thrust vectoring capability, it allowed the exhaust to be further cooled in the trenches, significantly reducing infrared signature when viewed from below the aircraft; the trenches in the aft deck were lined with tiles that were \"transpiration cooled\" from engine bleed air to withstand the heat of the exhaust.",
					"The specialized YF119 variants on the X-32 and X-35 had provisions for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations. The YF119-PW-614 on the X-32 had a pitch-axis thrust vectoring nozzle and valves can redirect the engine exhaust and bleed air to provide direct lift, similar to the Pegasus engine on the Harrier. In contrast, YF119-PW-611 on the X-35 had a round axisymmetric nozzle that can swivel downwards while the low-pressure spool drives a lift fan that's engaged through a clutch; engine bypass air is also routed to roll posts for additional lift and stability. The X-35 won the JSF competition and its shaft-driven lift fan system, called LiftSystem, was fully developed by Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney for the F135-PW-600.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney F135 is an afterburning turbofan developed for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine strike fighter. It has two variants; a Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant used in the F-35A and F-35C, and a two-cycle Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant used in the F-35B  that includes a forward lift fan. The first production engines were delivered in 2009.",
					"Developed from the Pratt & Whitney F119 engine used on the F-22 Raptor, the F135 produces around 28,000 lbf (125 kN) of thrust and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner. The F135 competed with the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 to power the F-35.",
					"The F135 originated with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with efforts to develop a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA program. Lockheed employee Paul Bevilaqua developed and patented a concept aircraft and propulsion system, and then turned to Pratt & Whitney (P&W) to build a demonstrator engine. The ground test demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The engine fan and core from the F100-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the \"F100-229-Plus\" demonstrator engine. This engine proved the lift-fan concept and led to the development of the current F135 engine.",
					"The F135 team is made up of Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and Hamilton Sundstrand.  Pratt & Whitney is the prime contractor for the main engine, and systems integration.  Rolls-Royce is responsible for the vertical lift system for the STOVL aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is responsible for the electronic engine control system, actuation system, PMAG, gearbox, and health monitoring systems.  Woodward, Inc. is responsible for the fuel system.",
					"P&W developed the F135 from their F119 turbofan, which powers the F-22 Raptor, as the \"F119-JSF\". The F135 integrates the F119 core with new components optimized for the JSF.  The F135 is assembled at a plant in Middletown, Connecticut.  Some parts of the engine are made in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, and in Poland.",
					"The first production propulsion system for operational service was scheduled for delivery in 2007 with the purpose of serving the U.S., UK, and other international customers. The initial F-35s went into production with the F135 engines, but the GE/Rolls-Royce team planned to develop a replacement F136 engine in July 2009. In 2010, the Pentagon planned for the two propulsion systems to be competitively tendered. However, since 2006 the Defense Department has not requested funding for the alternate F136 engine program, but Congress has maintained program funding.",
					"As of 2009, P&W developed a more durable version of the F135 engine to increase the service life of key parts. The life expectancy of the parts was reduced because the hot sections of the engine (combustor and high-pressure turbine blades specifically) ran hotter than expected. The test engine is designated XTE68/LF1, and testing is expected to begin in 2010. This redesign has caused “substantial cost growth.”",
					"P&W expected to deliver the F135 below the cost of the F119, even though it was a more powerful engine. However, in February 2013 a cracked turbine blade was found during a scheduled inspection. The crack was caused by operating at high turbine temperatures for longer periods than usual. In December 2013 the hollow first stage fan blisk failed at 77% of its expected life during a ground test. It was to be replaced by a solid part adding 6 lb (2.7 kg) in weight. In 2013, a former P&W employee was caught attempting to ship \"numerous boxes\" of sensitive information about the F135 to Iran.",
					"Despite the troubles, the 100th engine was delivered in 2013. LRIP-6 was agreed in 2013 for $1.1 billion for 38 engines of various types, which helped to decrease the unit cost.",
					"Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher C. Bogdan, the executive officer of the F-35 program, has called out P&W for falling short on manufacturing quality of the engines and slow deliveries. His deputy director Rear Admiral Randy Mahr said that P&W stopped their cost-cutting efforts after \"they got the monopoly\". In 2013 the price of the F135 increased by $4.3 billion.",
					"In May 2014, Pratt & Whitney discovered conflicting documentation about the origin of titanium material used in some of its engines, including the F135. The company assessed that the uncertainty did not pose a risk to safety of flight but suspended engine deliveries as a result. Bogdan supported P&W's actions and said the problem was now with A&P Alloys, the supplier. The US Defense Contract Management Agency wrote in June 2014 that Pratt & Whitney's \"continued poor management of suppliers is a primary driver for the increased potential problem notifications.\" A&P Alloys stated that they stood behind their product even though they were not given access to the parts to do their own testing. Tracy Miner, an attorney with Boston-based Demeo LLP representing A&P Alloys said, \"it is blatantly unfair to destroy A&P’s business without allowing A&P access to the materials in question\"",
					"In July 2014 there was an uncontained failure of a fan rotor while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before the flight, flexing of the engine caused excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator initiating the impending failure. The rub caused a temperature of over 1,000 °C (1,900 °F), well beyond the material limit of 540 °C (1,000 °F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured a fuel tank and hot air mixing with fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.",
					"Pratt & Whitney managed to meet their 2015 production goals, but \"recurring manufacturing quality issues\" in turbine blades and electronic control systems required engines to be pulled from the fleet.",
					"Derived from the F119 engine, the F135 is a mixed-flow afterburning turbofan with a new fan and LP turbine.",
					"There are two F135 variants: the -100 and the -600 versions.  A -400 version is mentioned, similar to the -100, the main difference being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials. The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering. The engine and Rolls-Royce LiftSystem make up the Integrated Lift Fan Propulsion System (ILFPS).",
					"The vertical thrust for the STOVL version is obtained from a two-stage lift fan (about 46%) in front of the engine, a vectoring exhaust nozzle (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using fan air from the bypass duct (about 8%). These contributions to the total lift are based on thrust values of 18,680 lbf (83.1 kN), 18,680 lbf (83.1 kN) and 3,290 lbf (14.6 kN) respectively. Another source gives thrust values of 20,000 lbf (89 kN), 18,000 lbf (80 kN), and 3,900 lbf (17 kN) respectively.",
					"In this configuration most of the bypass flow is ducted to the wing nozzles, known as roll posts. Some is used for cooling the rear exhaust nozzle, known as the 3-bearing swivel duct nozzle (3BSD). At the same time an auxiliary inlet is opened on top of the aircraft to provide additional air to the engine with low distortion during the hover.",
					"The low pressure (LP) turbine drives the lift fan through a shaft extension on the front of the LP rotor and a clutch. The engine operates as a separate flow turbofan with a higher bypass ratio. The power to drive the fan—about 30,000 shp (22,000 kW)—is obtained from the LP turbine by increasing the hot nozzle area.",
					"A higher bypass ratio increases the thrust for the same engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F135 is providing vertical lift using the increased bypass ratio from the lift fan, the thrust augmentation is 50% with no increase in fuel flow. Thrust augmentation is 52% in conventional flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow.",

The F-35 can achieve a limited 100% throttle cruise without afterburners of Mach 1.2 for 150 miles (240 km; 130 nmi).",
					"Like the F119, the F135 has a stealthy augmentor where traditional spray bars and flameholders are replaced by thick curved vanes coated with ceramic radar-absorbent materials (RAM). Afterburner fuel injectors are integrated into these vanes, which block line-of-sight of the turbines, contributing to aft-sector stealth. The axisymmetric nozzle consists of fifteen partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge. This creates shed vortices and reduces the infrared signature of the exhaust plume. The effectiveness is reportedly comparable to that of the F119's wedge nozzles, while being substantially more cost effective and lower maintenance.",
					"The engine uses thermoelectric-powered sensors to monitor turbine bearing health.",
					"Improving engine reliability and ease of maintenance is a major objective for the F135. The engine has fewer parts than similar engines, which improves reliability. All line-replaceable components (LRCs) can be removed and replaced with a set of six common hand tools. The F135's health management system is designed to provide real time data to maintainers on the ground. This allows them to troubleshoot problems and prepare replacement parts before the aircraft returns to base. According to Pratt & Whitney, this data may help drastically reduce troubleshooting and replacement time, as much as 94% over legacy engines.",
					"Although no service has issued a requirement for an upgraded engine, Pratt and Whitney is cooperating with the US Navy on a two-block improvement plan for the F135 engine. The goals of Block 1 are a 7–10% increase in thrust and a 5–7% lower fuel burn. The plans include better cooling technology for turbine blades; this would increase the longevity of the engine and substantially reduce maintenance costs. The goal of Block 2 is to work with the US Air Force's Adaptive Engine Transition Program, with the intention of introducing technology for an engine rated at 45,000 lb of thrust, to be used in a sixth-generation fighter.",
					"At the end of May 2017 Pratt and Whitney announced the F135 Growth Option 1 had finished testing and was available for production. The upgrade requires the changing of the power module on older engines and can be seamlessly inserted into future production engines at a minimal increase in unit cost and no impact to delivery schedule. The Growth Option 1 offers an improvement of 6–10% thrust across the F-35 flight envelope while also getting a 5–6% fuel burn reduction.",
					"In June 2018, United Technologies, parent company of P&W, announced Growth Option 2.0 to help provide increased power and thermal management system (PTMS) capacity, providing options for operators for instance if they are wishing to upgrade to heavier weapons.",

The F401 was intended to power the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and Rockwell XFV-12, but the engine was canceled due to costs and development issues.",
					"In 1967, the United States Air Force and United States Navy issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX, the fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970. This engine program was called the Initial Engine Development Program (IEDP), and was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
					"The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program.  General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. At the end of the IEDP, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition, the McDonnell Douglas F-15. The engine was designated the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine. The Air Force would award Pratt & Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would use the engine in the planned F-14B and the Rockwell XFV-12 project, but would cut back and later cancel its order with the latter's failure, and chose to continue to use the Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14.",
					"The F401 was the naval variant of the F100 design, sharing its core design while having a larger fan for greater bypass ratio, cruise efficiency and static thrust. The turbomachinery layout is largely the same as the F100, with the exception of an additional compressor stage driven by the low-pressure spool. The F401 produced 14,871 lbf (66.15 kN) in max continuous power, 16,489 lbf (73.35 kN) in military power, and 28,096 lbf (124.98 kN) augmented (in afterburner). This engine was intended to replace the TF30 in the originally planned F-14B and a prototype was first flown in 1973. Due to costs and the reliability issues that dogged early F100s, the F401 was eventually cancelled in 1974; the F-14B designation would later be used for F-14s re-engined with the General Electric F110. The F401 was also used in the developmental XFV-12, as well as the proposed Convair Model 200, and the Vought Model 1600, a naval F-16 derivative.",

It powered the A-6 Intruder and the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. As of 2021[update] the engine was still in use in models of the A-4 Skyhawk.",
					"The engine is the basis for the Pratt & Whitney JT8D, a popular civilian low-bypass turbofan engine.",
					"The J52 was developed in the mid-1950s for the US Navy as a scaled-down derivative of the J57/JT3A. It was initially intended to power the A4D-3 Skyhawk, an advanced avionics model that was canceled in 1957. After being canceled, the U.S. Air Force selected the J52 to power the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. The engine was designed with several unique features for this application, including a \"conical centerbody mounted in the intake\" and a \"variable central plug ... in the nozzle\". Then, in 1958, the US Navy selected the engine to power what became the A-6 Intruder.",

					"The twin-spool J52 employs a split 12-stage axial compressor consisting of a five-stage low pressure unit and a seven-stage high pressure unit. Behind the compressor is a nine-unit can-annular combustion chamber and a two-stage split turbine.",
					"In 1960, U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) developed procedures so that the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could use the Hound Dog's J52 engine for additional thrust while the missile was located on the bomber's two pylons. This helped heavily laden B-52s fly away from their airbases faster, which would have been useful in case of nuclear attacks on the bases. The Hound Dog could then be refueled from the B-52's wing fuel tanks."

					"The Pratt & Whitney J57 (company designation: JT3C) is an axial-flow turbojet engine developed by Pratt & Whitney in the early 1950s. The J57 (first run January 1950) was the first 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust class engine in the United States. The J57/JT3C was developed into the J52 turbojet, the J75/JT4A turbojet, the JT3D/TF33 turbofan, and the XT57 turboprop (of which only one was built). The J57 and JT3C saw extensive use on fighter jets, jetliners, and bombers for many decades.",
					"The J57 was a development of the Pratt & Whitney XT45 (PT4) turboprop engine that was originally intended for the Boeing XB-52. As the B-52 power requirements grew, the design evolved into a turbojet, the JT3.",
					"Pratt & Whitney designed the J57 to have a relatively high overall pressure ratio to help improve both Thrust-specific fuel consumption and specific thrust, but it was known that throttling a single high pressure ratio compressor would cause stability problems. As Sir Stanley Hooker explains in his autobiography, the outlet area of a compressor is significantly smaller than that of its inlet, which is fine when operating at the design pressure ratio, but during starting and at low throttle settings the compressor pressure ratio is low so ideally the outlet area should be much larger than its design value. Put crudely the air taken in at the front cannot get out the back, which causes the blades at the front of the compressor to stall and vibrate. The compressor surges, which normally means the airflow reverses direction, causing a sharp drop in thrust.",
					"By the late 1940s, three potential solutions to the stability problem had been identified:",
					"1) bleeding any excess compressed air at part speed overboard through interstage blow-off valves",
					"2) incorporating variable geometry in the first few stages of the compressor",
					"3) splitting the compressor into two units, one of which supercharges the other, with both units being mounted on separate shafts and driven by their own turbine",
					"GE adopted the second option with their General Electric J79, while Pratt & Whitney adopted the two-spool arrangement with their J57.",
					"P&W realized that if they could develop a modest pressure ratio (< 4.5:1) axial compressor to handle adequately at any throttle setting including starting and acceleration, they could put two such compressors in series to achieve a higher overall pressure ratio.",
					"In a two-spool arrangement, the first compressor, usually called Low Pressure Compressor (LPC), is driven by the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), and supercharges another unit known as the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) itself driven by the High Pressure Turbine (HPT). During starting the HP spool starts to rotate first, while the LP spool is stationary. As the HP spool accelerates and the fuel:air mixture in the combustor lights up, at some point there is sufficient energy in the turbine gas stream to start to rotate the LP spool, which accelerates, albeit more sluggishly. Eventually, at full throttle, both spools will rotate at their design speeds. Because the exit temperature of the HPC is obviously higher than that of the LPC, a similar blade tip Mach number for both units is achieved by making the design HP shaft speed significantly higher than that of the LP shaft. Any reductions in compressor diameter going towards the combustor exaggerates the difference.",
					"In the same timeframe as the J57, the Bristol Aeroplane Company Engine Division in the UK also adopted the two-spool arrangement into their Olympus turbojet engine series, which went on to propel the Avro Vulcan bomber and later the Concorde. Within a few months, both P&W and Bristol had had a first run of their prototypes. Both demonstrated superb handling.",
					"Today, most civil and military turbofans have a two spool configuration, a notable exception being the Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan series which has three spools.",
					"Incidentally, most modern civil turbofans use all three of the above options to handle the extremely high overall pressure ratios employed today (50:1 typically).",
					"During the 1950s the J57 was an extremely popular engine, with numerous military applications. Production figures were in the thousands, which led to a very reliable engine. Consequently, it was only natural for Boeing to choose the J57 civil variant, the JT3C, for their 707 jetliner. Douglas did likewise with their DC-8. Pressure to reduce jet noise and specific fuel consumption later resulted in P&W using an innovative modification to convert the JT3C turbojet into the JT3D two spool turbofan, initially for civil purposes, but also for military applications like the Boeing B-52H. The prestigious Collier Trophy for 1952 was awarded to Leonard S. Hobbs, Chief Engineer of United Aircraft Corporation, for \"designing and producing the P&W J57 turbojet engine\". The engine was produced from 1951 to 1965 with a total of 21,170 built.",
					"Many J57 models shipped since 1954 contained 7-15% of titanium, by dry weight. Commercially pure titanium was used in the inlet case and low pressure compressor case, whereas the low pressure rotor assembly was made up of 6Al-4V titanium alloy blades, discs and disc spacers. ",
					"Titanium alloys used in the J57 in the mid-50s suffered hydrogen embrittlement: 412  until the problem was understood.",
					"On May 25, 1953, a J57-powered YF-100A exceeded Mach 1 on its first flight.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney J58 (company designation JT11D-20) is an American jet engine that powered the Lockheed A-12, and subsequently the YF-12 and the SR-71 aircraft. It was an afterburning turbojet engine with a unique compressor bleed to the afterburner that gave increased thrust at high speeds. Because of the wide speed range of the aircraft, the engine needed two modes of operation to take it from stationary on the ground to 2,000 mph (3,200 km/h) at altitude. It was a conventional afterburning turbojet for take-off and acceleration to Mach 2 and then used permanent compressor bleed to the afterburner above Mach 2. The way the engine worked at cruise led it to be described as \"acting like a turboramjet\". It has also been described as a turboramjet based on incorrect statements describing the turbomachinery as being completely bypassed.",
					"The engine performance that met the mission requirements for the CIA and USAF over many years was later enhanced slightly for NASA experimental work (carrying external payloads on the top of the aircraft), which required more thrust to deal with higher aircraft drag.",
					"The J58, company designation JT11, had its origins in the larger JT9 (J91) engine. It was a 3/4 scale JT9 with a mass flow of 300 lb/s (140 kg/s), down from 400 lb/s (180 kg/s). The JT11 was proposed to the US Navy under their designation J58. It was also proposed for various Navy and Air Force aircraft, e.g. Convair F-106, North American F-108, Convair B-58C, Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III, and North American A3J Vigilante, but none of these applications followed.",
					"The J58 began development for the US Navy to power the planned Martin P6M jet flying boat. The P6M started out using Allison J71-A-4 engines and then switched to the Pratt & Whitney J75, due to J58 development delays. Upon cancellation of the P6M, it was selected for the Convair Kingfish and for the Lockheed A-12, YF-12A and SR-71. Other sources link its origin to the USAF's requirement for a powerplant for the WS-110A, the future XB-70 Valkyrie.",
					"Analytical calculations of the performance of the original J58 showed 3 problems at Mach 2.5: \"exhaust pressure was equal to the inlet pressure, the compressor was deep in surge, and there was no cool air to the afterburner liner that would therefore melt\".",
					"The first problem was caused by too-high a compressor delivery temperature, which did not allow enough energy to be added in the engine combustor to provide any thrust from the gas generator. All the thrust-producing pressure in the jet-pipe came from ram, as with a ramjet, and none from the gas generator. Fuel for thrust could only be added in the afterburner, which became the only source of engine thrust. The speed at which the gas generator produced no thrust was raised from about Mach 2.5 to about Mach 3 by patented design changes. Beyond that speed, the gas generator would become a drag item with, at Mach 3.2, a pressure ratio of 0.9. Even minimum afterburner would not balance the drag. The effect was described qualitatively by Lockheed inlet designer David Campbell \"..with minimum afterburner the engine would be dragging on the engine mounts at high Mach numbers.\"",
					"The second problem (the compressor deep in surge) was caused by the compressor trying to operate at too-low a corrected speed in an area of its compressor map known as \"off-design\". The third problem was caused by the afterburner duct being cooled with too-hot turbine exhaust gas.",
					"U.S. Patent 3,344,606 describes the changes to the engine that extended the engine's capability to Mach 3.2. They included diverting 20% of the compressor entry air after the 4th compressor stage directly to the afterburner through six external tubes. This allowed the compressor to work properly with adequate surge margin and increased airflow into the compressor. Some of the increased flow left the compressor after the 4th stage as bypass to the afterburner, and some left the last compressor stage through the previously choked area. The increased airflow gave more thrust. The inlet guide vanes were modified with trailing-edge flaps to reduce blade flutter and prevent blade fatigue failures. The afterburner was cooled by the bleed air that was 400 °F (220 °C) cooler than the turbine exhaust gas. Not all the oxygen in the bleed air was available for combustion, as most of the bleed air was directed into the cooling shroud before entering the afterburner cavity for reheating. The improved afterburner cooling allowed a higher flame temperature, which gave more thrust.",
					"The engine was completely redesigned, except for the compressor and turbine aerodynamic definitions, so that it would be reliable running for prolonged periods at unprecedented temperatures, not only inside the engine but also surrounding the casings where the controls, accessories, electrical wiring and fuel and oil tubes were located.",
					"Two starting methods were used during the life of the A-12, YF-12 and SR-71 aircraft: an AG330 starter cart with two Buick V8 engines driving a common output shaft, or compressed air driving a small starter adapter. The air-start method superseded the cumbersome \"Buicks\" when better compressed air supplies became available.",
					"Any aircraft flying at three times the speed of sound is in a severe thermal environment, both from frictional heating and stagnation ram rise. The fuel was the only heat sink available to the aircraft and after absorbing 40,000 Btu/min (700 kW), keeping everything cool enough from the crew to the exhaust nozzle area indicator, it was supplied to the fuel nozzles at 600 °F (316 °C). To cope with these high temperatures, a new jet fuel with a low vapor pressure had to be developed. A chemical method for igniting the fuel, triethyl borane (TEB), was developed to match its low volatility. TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air above −5 °C. The engine and afterburner were lit with TEB and the afterburner also had a catalytic igniter that glowed in the hot turbine exhaust.  Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with 600 cm3 (21.1 imp fl oz; 20.3 US fl oz) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number was one of the limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.8 imp fl oz; 1.7 US fl oz) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.",
					"One heat source required two-stage reduction. Before entering the fuel heat-sink system, the Environmental Control System (ECS) air leaving the engine compressor at 1,230 °F (666 °C) was so hot that ram air at 760 °F (404 °C) had to be used first. Fuel flowing from the tanks to the engines was used to cool the air conditioning systems, aircraft hydraulic fluid, engine oil, accessory drive system oil, the TEB tank and afterburner nozzle actuator control lines.",
					"The development of the J58 involved some of the most challenging metallurgical development problems experienced by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft so far, with components operating at unprecedented temperatures and levels of stress and durability. New manufacturing techniques as well as new alloys improved the mechanical properties, and surface coatings had to be developed to protect components.",
					"Premature cracking of turbine vanes and blades made from conventionally cast (i.e. equiaxed) Mar-M200, the strongest cast nickel-base alloy, was avoided by the development of directionally solidified parts cast in the same material. Directionally solidified Mar-M200 became the strongest cast turbine material to date and was introduced in production engines. Single-crystal turbine blades cast in Mar-M200, giving further improvement of high temperature resistance, would also be developed through testing in J58 engines. Waspaloy was the most widely used alloy in the engine, from critical high-energy rotating compressor discs to components made from sheet. Although used for turbine discs in other engines, it did not have the required properties for J58 turbine discs. Astroloy, the strongest known nickel-base superalloy in the Western world at that time, was used instead. Waspaloy was also used initially for the diffuser case, the part that joins the compressor to the combustor and that contains the highest pressure in the engine. Diffuser case weld cracking led to the introduction of Inconel 718 for this part. The afterburner liner was sprayed with ceramic thermal barrier coating that, together with the cooling air from the compressor, allowed continuous use of the afterburner with flame temperatures up to 3,200 °F (1,760 °C).",
					"NASA was loaned 2 SR-71 aircraft for research work. One was modified to flight-test a Linear Aerospike rocket engine and was fitted with thrust-enhanced J58 engines. Engine thrust was increased by 5% to offset increased aircraft drag. The increased thrust came from a throttle push, or exhaust gas temperature uptrim, of 75 °F (42 °C). The increase was limited by the allowable reduction in life of the second-stage turbine blades (the life-limiting component) from 400 to 50 hours. The same thrust-enhancement studies used for this work also looked at an additional 5% thrust from additional afterburner fuel made possible with oxidizer injection (nitrous oxide). The nitrous oxide rate would have been limited by thermal choking of the nozzle.",
					"As of 2021[update], the J58 is the only known aircraft engine designed to operate continuously at maximum afterburning at high Mach number cruise. J58 experience was used extensively in the JTF17 engine proposal for a Mach 2.7 SST, due to significant flight time at Mach 2.7 and above. It was also used for subsequent engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, both commercial and military. The next afterburning engine, the TF30 as installed in the F-111, used an airframe-mounted secondary nozzle with free-floating flaps similar to that used on the SR-71.",
					"J58 emissions were measured as part of the NASA Stratospheric Wake Experiment, which looked at the environmental impact of using afterburning jet engines for supersonic transports. An engine was tested in an altitude chamber at a maximum condition of full afterburning at Mach 3.0 and 19.8 km altitude.",
					"Alternative solutions to combat the adverse effects of high inlet temperature on the aerodynamic performance of the compressor were rejected by the Pratt & Whitney patentee, Robert Abernethy. One of those solutions was used in a contemporary installation. The GE YJ93/XB-70 used a variable-stator compressor to avoid front-stage stall and rear-stage choking.",
					"Another possible solution, pre-compressor cooling, was used on the MiG-25. Water/methanol was injected from a spray mast in front of the compressor to lower the intake temperature for short durations at maximum speed. Pre-compressor cooling was also proposed for a Mach 3 reconnaissance Phantom and the Mach 3+ F-106 RASCAL project.",
					"The propulsion system consisted of the intake, engine, nacelle or secondary airflow and ejector nozzle (propelling nozzle). The propulsive thrust distribution between these components changed with flight speed: at Mach 2.2 inlet 13% – engine 73% – ejector 14%; at Mach 3.0+ inlet 54% – engine 17.6% – ejector 28.4%.",
					"The intake had to supply air to the engine with acceptable pressure loss and distortion. It had to do this in all flight conditions.",
					"The ejector, or secondary, nozzle performed the reverse function of the inlet accelerating the turbine exhaust from about Mach 1.0, as it left the primary nozzle, back up to Mach 3. Mach 3 exhaust velocity is higher than Mach 3 flight velocity due to the much-higher temperature in the exhaust. The nacelle airflow from the intake controlled the expansion of the hot engine exhaust in the ejector nozzle. This air flowed around the engine and served also to cool the hot external parts of the engine and to purge any combustible mixtures in the event of a fuel or oil leak in the nacelle.",

A two-spool design in the 17,000 lbf (76 kN) thrust class, the J75 was essentially the bigger brother of the Pratt & Whitney J57 (JT3C). It was known in civilian service as the JT4A, and in a variety of stationary roles as the GG4 and FT4.",
					"In military use, the J75 was used on the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Lockheed U-2, and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. It was also utilized in the prototype and experimental Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, Lockheed A-12, Martin P6M SeaMaster, North American YF-107, and Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III.",
					"Before the arrival of the Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan engine, the JT4A was used to power certain Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 models, bringing improved field performance in the medium-range Boeing 707-220 and Douglas DC-8-20, and intercontinental range in the Boeing 707-320 and the Douglas DC-8-30.  By late 1959, P&W had considered introducing a turbofan version of the J75, which was to have tentatively been named the TF75 or JT4D. Apparently, little interest was shown by the aircraft industry, so the variant was dropped.[citation needed]",
					"After its relatively short lifetime in the aircraft role, the JT4A found more enduring use in the naval role, where the FT4 was produced in a variety of models between 18,000 and 22,000 hp (13 and 16 MW). Well-known uses include the first all-turbine warships, the Canadian Iroquois-class destroyers, as well as the United States Coast Guard's Hamilton-class cutters, the 1970s-built icebreakers Polar Sea and Polar Star (each 3 engines in CODOG configuration), and it was considered for the US Navy's Asheville-class gunboat. The same basic powerplant saw much wider use as a peak demand power turbine running on natural gas. From its introduction in 1960 over 1,000 FT4s have been sold, with many of them still in operation for electrical generation. Outdated by modern standards, refits are available that add catalytic converters to lower their emissions.",

Over 8,000 JT3Ds were produced between 1959 and 1985. Most JT3D engines still in service today are used on military aircraft, where the engine is referred to by its US military designation of TF33.",
					"Aware of the competition from the Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan, Pratt & Whitney decided to develop the JT3D turbofan from the JT3C turbojet for later deliveries of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, then nearing entry into service. A 2-stage fan replaced the first 3 stages of the 9-stage JT3C LP compressor. On the LP turbine, the second stage was enlarged and a third stage added.",
					"Unlike GE with the CJ805-23, Pratt & Whitney had not undertaken any transonic fan research prior to designing the JT3D, so they were unable to incorporate a single stage unit into the specification.

					"In 1959, important orders for the engine were the Boeing 707-120B and Boeing 720B when American Airlines ordered one 707 powered by JT3D turbofans and KLM ordered a JT3D-powered Douglas DC-8. Earlier 707s and DC-8s had been powered by the JT3C and JT4A turbojets, and the improved efficiency of the turbofan soon attracted the airlines. A JT3D-powered 707-123B and 720-023B (the suffix B was to indicate a turbofan-powered aircraft) entered service with American Airlines on the same day, March 12, 1961.",
					"The Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers were all originally powered by turbojet engines. With the demise of many airline 707s, the United States Air Force took the opportunity to buy the surplus airframes and use the engines to re-fit the KC-135As used by the Air National Guard and reserve squadrons with the civilian JT3D (designated TF33-PW-102). Over 150 aircraft were modified and the former KC-135A was re-designated the KC-135E.",
					"After long service for both airlines and air forces, the number of JT3D-powered aircraft is steadily decreasing. One hundred thirty five KC-135s use the JT3D, while 354 were fitted with CFM International CFM56 engines, which provide greater thrust, lower fuel consumption, and increased operational flexibility due to their lower noise footprint. The noise of the JT3D is one of the reasons NATO has debated re-fitting their E-3 Sentry AWACS fleet, since the aircraft are subject to restrictions that aircraft with modern engines are not. Operational flexibility would be further increased due to the ability of higher power engines to increase the ceiling of the aircraft, extending the horizon for radar surveillance; for instance, RAF, French and Saudi E-3s routinely fly higher than NATO/USAF counterparts.",
					"In 1961, the TF33-powered Boeing B-52H Stratofortress entered service. The \"H\" model of the B-52 was the only production variant of the heavy bomber to be fitted with turbofan engines, and is the only model remaining in United States Air Force service. It is expected to remain as a mainstay of the Air Force heavy bomber fleet until at least 2040, with options for replacing the 8 TF33 engines with more modern equivalents being considered. In April 2020, the USAF released a request for proposals for 608 commercial replacement engines, with the plan to award the contract in May 2021. In September 2021, the USAF announced that the TF33 would be replaced by the Rolls-Royce F130.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney JT8D is a low-bypass (0.96 to 1) turbofan engine introduced by Pratt & Whitney in February 1963 with the inaugural flight of the Boeing 727. It was a modification of the Pratt & Whitney J52 turbojet engine which powered the US Navy A-6 Intruder and A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft. Eight models comprise the JT8D standard engine family, covering the thrust range from 12,250 to 17,400 pounds-force (54 to 77 kN), and power the 727, 737-100/200, and DC-9. The updated JT8D-200 family, covering the 18,900 to 21,000 pounds-force (84 to 93 kN), powers the MD-80 and re-engined Super 27 aircraft. The JT8D was built under license in Sweden as the Volvo RM8, a redesigned afterburning derivative for the Saab 37 Viggen fighter. Pratt & Whitney also sells static versions for powerplant and ship propulsion as the FT8.",
					"The JT8D is an axial-flow front turbofan engine incorporating a two-spool design. There are two coaxially-mounted independent rotating assemblies: one rotating assembly for the low pressure compressor (LPC) which consists of the first six stages (i.e. six pairs of rotating and stator blades, including the first two stages which are for the bypass turbofan), driven by the second (downstream) turbine (which consists of three stages); and a second rotating assembly for the high-pressure compressor (HPC) section, which has seven stages.  The high-pressure compressor is driven by the first (upstream) turbine, which has a single stage.",
					"The front-mounted bypass fan has two stages. The annular discharge duct for the bypass fan runs along the full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle.  This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine exhaust is shrouded in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air.  Thus, the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced.",
					"Within the fan inlet case, there are anti-icing air bosses and probes to sense the inlet pressure and temperature.  Similar units exist throughout the engine to check temperatures and pressures.",
					"At the 13th (i.e. the final) compressor stage, air is bled out and used for anti-icing.  The amount is controlled by the Pressure Ratio Bleed Control sense signal (PRBC).  The diffuser case at the aft end of the compressor houses the 13th stage.  Its increasing cross-sectional area allows the compressed air to slow down before entering one of the engine's nine burner cans.  Again, there are two bosses to extract 13th stage air for anti-icing, de-icing of fuel, and airframe (cabin pressurization) use.  Not all the compressed air enters the burner cans at the fuel-ignition point; some bypasses the can completely and cools the first turbine stage, and some is gradually introduced into the burner can's perimeter in such a way that the burning fuel is held near the can's centerline.",
					"There are nine combustion chambers positioned in a can-annular arrangement. Each chamber has three air inlet hole sizes: the smallest is for cooling, the medium is for burning and the largest for forming an air blanket.",
					"20 in (510 mm) diameter rotor and bypass stator",
					"In response to environmental concerns that began in the 1970s, the company began developing a new version of the engine, the JT8D-200 series.  Designed to be quieter, cleaner, more efficient, yet more powerful than earlier models, the -200 Series power-plant was re-engineered with a significantly higher bypass ratio (1.74 to 1) covering the 18,500 to 21,700 pound-force (82 to 97 kN) thrust range and powering the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series.  This increase was achieved by increasing bypass fan diameter from 39.9 inches (101 cm) to 49.2 inches (125 cm) and reducing fan pressure ratio (from 2.21 to 1.92).[citation needed]  Overall engine pressure ratio was also increased from 15.4 to 21.0. Since entering service in 1980, more than 2,900 of the -200 series engines have been produced.",
					"The JT8D-217 and -219 engine(s) were tested in 2001 and were deemed suitable replacements for the old TF33 engines on military and commercial aircraft as part of the Super 27 re-engining program.  The updated engines offer reduced (Stage-3) noise compliance standards without the need for hush kits, enhanced short field performance, and steeper and faster climb rates with roughly a 10% reduction in fuel burn for extended range.",
					"Pratt & Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, has developed the JT8D-219 as a re-engine powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft. Northrop Grumman used the -219 to re-engine one of the United States Air Force's fleet of 19 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8 Joint STARS) aircraft, which would allow the JSTARS more time on station due to the engine's 17%  greater fuel efficiency. NATO plans to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing 707 re-engine powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, for reasons of geometrical and balance similarity to the engine it is replacing and the associated relative up-front wing modification costs of the two choices.",
					"The proposed Aerion SBJ supersonic business jet, previously under development, was to use a pair of JT8D-219 engines for sustained supersonic flight.",
					"More than 14,000 JT8D engines have been produced, totaling more than one-half billion hours of service, with more than 350 operators, making it the most popular of all low-bypass turbofan engines ever produced.  Regular production ended in 1985, but some replacement engines were produced for military aircraft in 2011. Mainline airline use of the JT8D continued until 2020 when Delta Air Lines retired their MD-88 fleet early due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

By 2020, the JT9D had flown more than 169 million hours.Production ceased in 1990, to be replaced by the new PW4000.",

The engine's first test run took place in a test rig at East Hartford, Connecticut, with the engine's first flight in June 1968 mounted on a Boeing B-52E which served as a JT9D flying testbed.In 1968, its unit cost was $800,000, $6.7 million today.",
					"The JT9D introduced advanced technologies in structures, aerodynamics, and materials, which included titanium alloys and nickel alloys, to improve fuel efficiency and reliability compared to the Pratt & Whitney JT3D earlier turbofan.The engine featured a single-stage fan, a three-stage low-pressure compressor, and an eleven-stage high-pressure compressor coupled to a two-stage high-pressure turbine and four-stage low-pressure turbine.

					"The Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX was an experimental aircraft engine, a hybrid between a turbofan and a turboprop known as a propfan. The engine was designed in the 1980s to power proposed propfan aircraft such as the Boeing 7J7 and the MD-91 and MD-92 derivatives of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80. As of 2019, it is still one of only four different contra-rotating propfan engines to have flown in service or in flight testing.",
					"The Allison Engine Company, a division of automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM), unveiled its Model 578 contra-rotating propfan engine at the Paris Air Show in mid-1985. The engine represented Allison's attempt to re-enter the commercial airline engine market, because after turboprop aircraft were overtaken in civil aviation in the 1950s and 1960s, Allison was mostly confined to selling military aircraft engines. Targeted to power passenger airliners seating between 100 and 160 passengers, the engine would be based on the core of the Allison T701 heavy lift helicopter turboshaft engine, which first ran in 1975. The engine would come in two sizes: a 10,000 shaft horsepower (7,500 kilowatts) variant with a 23:1 compression ratio and a three-stage boost compressor and power turbine added to the T701 core, and a 16,000 shaft hp (12,000 kW) variant with a 33:1 pressure ratio and a four-stage boost and power section. Since Allison estimated that a 100-seat plane required two 9,000–10,000 shaft hp (6,700–7,500 kW) engines and that a 150-seat plane needed two 13,000–15,000 shaft hp (9,700–11,200 kW) engines, the two sizes chosen should handle the 100-160 passenger aircraft market. Allison hoped to have its 578 engine ready for flight tests in late 1987.",
					"Allison and United Technologies aircraft engine division Pratt & Whitney announced on March 14, 1986 that they would develop the engine as a joint venture. The agreement, which was signed on February 25, was reached because Pratt & Whitney would not be able to develop its own propfan engine by the planned 1992 certification date of the 7J7, and because it also did not have an engine core in the size range of 10,000–16,000 shaft hp (7,500–11,900 kW). Allison would develop the engine and perform ground testing, while Pratt & Whitney would integrate the propulsion system into the aircraft and manage the flight test program.",
					"On February 23, 1987 in Detroit, Michigan, Pratt & Whitney and Allison officially formed a joint company named PW–Allison Engines. The new company claimed that compared a commercial jet engine, its propfan engines would consume 30-percent less fuel, require shorter runway lengths during takeoffs and landings, and be quieter (because of the slower propfan rotational speeds enabled by the 578's gearbox). The partnership would last 20 years and cover geared propfan development in the 8,200–16,000 shaft hp (6,100–11,900 kW) range, though the power range could be increased by fifteen percent with a specific mechanical modification. The new company also expected Japanese and European engine makers to eventually join its program instead of creating competing propfan engines. PW–Allison Engines was to invest at least 500 million dollars to bring the engine into commercial production (depending on airline commitments to buy aircraft using its engines), and it assumed that the new company would take half of the market for new medium-sized airliners over the next ten years—a 13-to-18 billion dollar market, it estimated. Pratt & Whitney would handle the marketing to commercial customers, while Allison would do the marketing to military customers. Other members of the new company included GM subsidiaries Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics and United Technologies subsidiary Hamilton Standard, the propeller manufacturer that invented the propfan concept with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s.",
					"On December 20, 1985, Boeing and Allison agreed to test its new propfan engine for use on the Boeing 7J7. As of early 1986, Allison maintained that it could have its propfan engine certified by early 1990, although a few months later the company changed the certification target timeline to 1992. By early/mid 1987, Boeing had rejected using the PW–Allison engine for its 7J7. Although Boeing had not tested PW–Allison's propfan in flight, the airframer said that the PW–Allison engine's off-the-shelf core was not powerful enough to power the 150-seat plane. PW–Allison vigorously objected, claiming its engine's gearbox could handle 13,000 shaft hp (9,700 kW), the agreement between Pratt & Whitney and Allison covered up to 16,000 shaft hp (12,000 kW), and the gearbox design could go to 25,000 shaft hp (19,000 kW). The decision became moot in December 1987, when Boeing indefinitely suspended development of the 7J7 aircraft, four months after delaying the 7J7 availability date from 1992 to 1993.",
					"In January 1986, Allison also signed a memorandum of understanding with McDonnell Douglas to perform flight tests on the Allison demonstrator engine, now known as the 578-DX, on an MD-80 testbed in late 1987. The flight test program was in preparation for McDonnell Douglas's ultra-high bypass (UHB) MD-91X derivative, a 114-seat airliner that had a planned service entry in the early 1990s. The demonstrator engine would convert 10,400 shaft hp (7,800 kW) into 19,000 pounds-force (85 kilonewtons) of thrust. One engine would be built for ground testing, while another would be used in flight tests. The 578-DX would follow in testing the competing General Electric GE36 UDF engine, which was scheduled for 75 hours of flight tests on the MD-80 testbed from May 1987 through August 1987; the 578-DX would complete its 75 hours of flight testing from December 1987 through February 1988. During the middle of each engine's test program, McDonnell Douglas would let airline representatives fly in the testbed aircraft to assess the passenger experience. McDonnell Douglas would begin installing one 578-DX demonstrator on its testbed in September 1987, while PW-Allison would perform ground tests with its other 578-DX demonstrator from mid-June 1987 to November 1987. Ground testing was to begin around August 1987, and PW–Allison was confident that its engine would be flight tested by early December.",
					"A number of issues hindered the 578-DX, though. First, there was difficulty in manufacturing the thin, swept blades. Then, after one test engine was disassembled for inspection, the second engine ingested parts of the first engine into its compressor during testing. These problems delayed flight tests until the end of February 1988, and they delayed ground testing of the engine until December 19, 1987. In February 1988, PW–Allison postponed the service entry date until the end of 1993 at the earliest, as it said that the 578-DX was not powerful enough for the MD-92, and the required increase in engine power from 14,000 to 16,000 shaft hp (10,000 to 12,000 kW) could not be finished in time for the McDonnell Douglas's 1992 target date. PW–Allison moved the beginning of flight tests to May 1988, but the flight date target was missed again because of endurance problems from the electrical pitch-change motors, so flight testing was put off until August to October of 1988.",
					"Amidst the flight test delays, McDonnell Douglas repeatedly expressed dismay that PW–Allison had not made a formal offer to place its engines into an MD-90 production program. The airframer wanted to offer its proposed derivatives to airlines with a choice of powerplant options, instead of advertising aircraft availability with just the competing GE36 UDF engine. However, PW–Allison refused to submit an offering to McDonnell Douglas and the airlines before its flight tests were completed and evaluated.",
					"Ground tests for the 578-DX finished on August 10, 1988 after almost 2,500 hours of runs, resulting in a successful preliminary flight rating test (PFRT), which cleared the way for flight testing. However, the 578-DX could not undergo flight tests until early 1989, because the GE36 demonstrator had been reinstalled on the MD-80 testbed for additional tests. The 578-DX was shipped off for testbed installation on October 18, 1988, and it was installed on the MD-80 testbed in November 1988. The testbed then performed ground runs and taxi tests at Edwards Air Force Base, with the first flight scheduled for January 1989. More delays occurred, though, including one during preparation for a planned March 12, 1989 first flight that was caused by an abrasion on the gearbox's bearing separator.",
					"Nearly a year and a half after the flight test was originally planned, the 578-DX engine finally flew on April 13, 1989, with the first five flights being described as performing \"flawlessly\" through nearly the whole flight envelope. At the time, the 578-DX demonstration program was planning to conduct 50 hours of flight tests over the upcoming three to four months. The demonstrator covered a flight envelope of up to Mach 0.77 and up to an altitude of 30,000 ft (9,100 m), with one flight attaining an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 340 knots (390 mph; 630 km/h) at an altitude of 22,000 feet (6,700 m), or over Mach 0.8. However, the 578-DX testbed aircraft ended up flying only through May 1989, making 14 test flights for a total of just 20 hours.",
					"Due to the absence of firm propfan orders, McDonnell Douglas announced in May 1989 that the V2500 turbofan engine from International Aero Engines (a multinational engine consortium that included Pratt & Whitney as a member) would be provided as a powerplant option for the MD-90 series. In September 1989, with the order drought continuing, McDonnell Douglas decided to offer the MD-90 series exclusively with the V2500 turbofan engine, ending the airliner sales prospects for the PW–Allison 578-DX propfan. Allison acknowledged that the higher price of its propfan, which some estimated to have a cost of US$4 million (or 40 percent higher than existing turbofan engines), would be unattractive to airline customers at the low fuel prices of the time. It also said that it would not perform any more flight tests of its propfan, preferring to study the data from the flight tests previously done on the MD-80.",
					"Allison's engine was also being examined by the military for airlift and reconnaissance aircraft, and it was offered unsuccessfully for some military aircraft applications. As of early 1988, the Allison 578-D engine was the base powerplant for the Future International Military/Civil Airlifter (FIMA) consortium, which intended to build a replacement military transport aircraft for the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the French-German Transall C-160 for American and western European military airfleets. The FIMA engine would be smaller than the demonstrator engine, as its contra-rotating propellers would have only four blades in front and four blades in back, and it would generate 8,800 hp (6,600 kW). The aircraft would fly at Mach 0.72 and operate from 2,000 to 3,000 ft (610 to 910 m) runway strips.",
					"The propfan engine had 11.6 ft diameter (3.5 m; 139 in; 350 cm) coaxial contra-rotating propellers, with the front and back propellers (supplied by Hamilton Standard) each containing six blades of 4.35 ft (1.33 m; 52.2 in; 133 cm) in length. The propellers had a recommended tip speed of 750 feet per second (230 metres per second; 510 miles per hour; 820 kilometres per hour), and the engine could support a maximum aircraft flight speed of Mach 0.80–0.82. 44 percent of the engine's torque would be handled by the front propeller, while the other 56 percent would be absorbed by the back propeller. The hot gas exhaust contributes just two to three percent of the total thrust. The 578-DX engine was longer and thinner than the competing GE36 UDF engine.",
					"The design adopted many aspects of the Allison 501-M78 single-rotation propfan engine, a single-rotation, 9 ft diameter (2.7 m; 110 in; 270 cm) powerplant being prepared for flight testing on a Gulfstream II business jet. The 501-M78 was an experimental engine that Allison was developing since 1984 as part of the NASA Propfan Test Assessment (PTA). It was a variant of the Allison T701 heavy lift helicopter turboshaft engine, which produced 8,079 shp (6,025 kW) and was also known as the Allison 501-M62B. The T701 was to power the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 helicopter, but after the XCH-62 was abandoned, the engine technology was redirected in 1976 toward an industrial gas turbine, which debuted in 1979 as the Allison 570-K. The 578-DX was derived from the Allison 571, a variant of the Allison 570 that entered service in 1985. There was much commonality in the participants of both engines: in addition to Allison supplying both of the engine cores, the PTA engine also used propellers designed by Hamilton Standard, and both the 501-M78 and the 578-DX had nacelles built by Rohr Industries. This arrangement facilitated the technology transfer from the 501-M78 to the 578-DX. In addition, the blades and the coaxial propellers on the 578-DX were inspired by the SR-7 single-rotation fan on the 501-M78 and the NASA-studied CRP-X1, a 2 ft contra-rotating (0.61 m; 24 in; 61 cm) model propfan with a 5x5 blade configuration.",
					"Unlike the GE36, the 578-DX was fairly conventional, having a reduction gearbox between the low-pressure turbine and the propfan blades, which was thought to give a fuel efficiency advantage of seven percent against the GE36, according to McDonnell Douglas. Allison, which developed the gearbox, claimed a fuel savings of ten percent and the elimination of 1,000 turbine blades. The demonstrator engines produced 10,400 horsepower (7,800 kilowatts), generating a thrust of 21,000 pounds-force (93 kilonewtons). The gearbox would have a reduction ratio of 8.33 to 1, and it would be in service to an airline for 30,000 flight hours (ten years) before requiring a major overhaul, which bettered the mean time between removals (MTBR) of 8,000 flight hours for the Allison T56 turboprop, Allison's top-performing gearbox. The new gearbox, which the propfan developers said had only 15 major parts and was technologically simple, would provide accessory access without having to remove the engine or gearbox, since half of the removals on the T56 historically were caused by failures of accessories. Instead of the six accessory drives used on the T56, the PW-Allison propfan would have no more than two accessory drives. The design was also aided by a study funded by NASA and Allison to develop a 13,000 shaft hp (9,700 kW) contra-rotating gearbox.",
					"Pratt & Whitney and Allison planned to offer their propfan in three different production models: the 578-D, which produced 11,800 hp (8,800 kW), climbed at an overall pressure ratio (OPR) of 23.4, and had a combustor exit temperature (CET) of 2,230 °F (1,220 °C; 2,690 °R; 1,490 K); the 578-E, a 13,500 hp (10,100 kW) model with a climb OPR of 31.3 and a CET of 2,390 °F (1,310 °C; 2,850 °R; 1,580 K); and the 578-F, the most powerful engine at 16,000 hp (12,000 kW), climbing at OPR 31.3 and with a CET of 2,535 °F (1,391 °C; 2,995 °R; 1,664 K). The 578-DX demonstrator engine did not completely reflect the design of the planned production models. For example, the 578-DX expels its hot exhaust gases forward of the propfan blades, initially requiring the use of heat-resistant blade materials to withstand the 500 °F (260 °C) exhaust stream, but the production engine design was modified to release the gases at the back of the engine to prevent the blades from heating up.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW1120 turbofan is a derivative of the F100 turbofan. It was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.",
					"The development of the PW1120, according to Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) specifications, started in June 1980. It retained the F100 core module, gearbox, fuel pump, forward ducts, as well as the F100 digital electronic control, with only minor modifications. Unique PW1120 components included a wide chord low pressure (LP) compressor, single-stage uncooled low pressure (LP) turbine, simplified single stream augmentor, and a lightweight convergent/divergent nozzle. Full scale testing was initiated in June 1982, and flight clearance of the PW1120 was tested in August 1984. The PW1120 had 70 percent similarity with the F100, so the IDF/AF would not need a special facility for spare parts. It would be built under licence by Bet-Shemesh Engines Limited in Israel.",
					"IAI installed one PW1120 in the starboard nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDF/AF (Number 334/66-0327) to explore the airframe/powerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as Kurnass 2000 (\"Heavy Hammer\") or Super Phantom and to act as an engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant baydoors, new airframe mounted gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic throttle system. It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant control/airframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986.",
					"Two PW1120 powerplants were installed in the same F-4E and it was flown for the first time on 24 April 1987. This proved very successful, allowing the Kurnass 2000 to exceed Mach 1 without the afterburners, and endowing a combat thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.04 (17 per cent better than the F-4E). This improved the sustained turn rate by 15 per cent, the climb rate by 36 per cent, medium-level acceleration by 27 per cent and low-level speed with 18 bombs from 1,046 km/h to 1,120 km/h (654 - 700 mph or 565 kn to 605 kn). It was demonstrated at the Paris Air Show in 1987."

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW1000G, also called the GTF (geared turbofan), is a high-bypass geared turbofan engine family produced by Pratt & Whitney.After many demonstrators, the program was launched with the PW1200G on the Mitsubishi SpaceJet (later cancelled) in March 2008, first flight tested in July 2008.The first variant to be certified was the PW1500G for the Airbus A220 in February 2013.The program cost is estimated at $10 billion.",
					"The gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure spool allows each to spin at its optimal speed, allowing a higher bypass ratio for a better propulsive efficiency.Pratt & Whitney claims the engine is 16% more fuel efficient than the previous generation, and up to 75% quieter.The first variant to enter service was the PW1100G for the Airbus A320neo in January 2016. The engine had teething problems after its introduction, extending to grounded aircraft and inflight failures, solved afterwards.The variants can generate 15,000 to 33,000 lbf (67 to 147 kN) of thrust.The engine is used on the A220, A320neo family, Embraer E-Jet E2 and Irkut MC-21.",
					"In summer 1993 Pratt & Whitney started to test its 53,000 lbf (240 kN) Advanced Ducted Propulsor (ADP) demonstrator at the NASA Ames wind tunnel, using a 4:1, 40,000 hp (30,000 kW) gearbox.Its 118.2 in (300 cm) fan with 18 reversing pitch composite blades had a 15:1 bypass ratio.It aimed to cut fuel consumption by 6–7%, emissions by 15%, and generate less noise due to lower fan tip speed of 950 ft/s (290 m/s), down from 1,400 ft/s (430 m/s) in conventional 5:1 bypass turbofans.While the gearbox and larger fan weighed more, this was mitigated by using 40% composites by weight, up from 15%.In 1994 P&W was planning to run a 60,000 hp (45,000 kW) gearbox for 75,000 lbf (330 kN) of thrust.",
					"P&W first attempted to build a production geared turbofan starting around 1998, with the PW8000, targeted for the 25,000–35,000 lbf (110–160 kN) range. This was an upgrade of the existing PW6000 that replaced the fan section with a gear box and a new single-stage fan, and aimed for 8–10% lower operating costs, or $600,000 per aircraft annually.",
					"The PW8000 had an 11:1 bypass ratio (twice that of the V2500), a 40:1 overall pressure ratio, and 13 compressor stages instead of the 22 in the V2500 for similar thrusts.Preliminary development was to end by June 1, the first test for 10 months later, and certification 20 months after, for $400 million.Pratt had tested gearboxes for 950 hours for $350 million in the previous decade and aimed for 99.5% efficiency.The ADP gearbox was 30% more powerful and the reversing pitch fan was not retained for the PW8000.P&W was to control 60% of the program, shared with IAE partners MTU and FiatAvio but not Rolls-Royce, and possibly with Volvo and MHI.",
					"Its LP turbine ran at 9,160 rpm, reduced by 3:1 for a 3,250 rpm fan having a 1,050 ft/s (320 m/s) blade tip speed down from 1,400 ft/s (430 m/s), dropping noise to 30 EPNdB cumulated below Stage 3 requirements.The 76–79 in (190–200 cm) fan had 20 titanium blades, and moved 1,369 lb (621 kg) of air per second in climb.The conventional 3-stage LP compressor was followed by a 5-stage, 12:1 HP compressor fitted with 700 blades inspired by the military ATEGG program's low aspect-ratio airfoils.A floatwall/TALON combustor was followed by a single stage HP turbine and a counter rotating 3-stage LP turbine with 400 blades, both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) optimized.The gearbox could handle 50 hp/lb (82 kW/kg). Eight engines would have been used for certification.After several years, the PW8000 project was abandoned.",
					"Soon afterwards the ATFI project appeared, using a PW308 core but with a new gearbox and a single-stage fan.[citation needed] It had its first run on March 16, 2001.[citation needed] This led to the Geared Turbofan (GTF) program, which was based around a newly designed core jointly developed with German MTU Aero Engines.[citation needed]",
					"After the budget of NASA on aeronautics research was severely cut at the start of 2006, Pratt & Whitney committed to spend $100 million a year on the geared turbofan (GTF) development for the next generation of single-aisle airliners, focused on the 25,000–35,000 lbf (110–160 kN) thrust range.By then, P&W was supporting 36% of the engines in the Western-operated commercial fleet, compared to CFM's 33% (growing), GE's 13%, Rolls-Royce's 11%, and IAE' 6% (growing); but it was decreasing as it was mostly based on the older JT8D.The company was hoping the GTF could cut fuel burn by up to 12% and noise by 31dB compared with then-current engines.P&W was planning a ground engine demonstration in late 2007, aimed at 30,000 lbf (130 kN) thrust with a 2 m (80 in)-diameter fan.The first ground test of the demonstrator was performed in November 2007 at West Palm Beach, Florida.",
					"In October 2007, the GTF was selected to power the 70- to 90-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ).In March 2008, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launched the MRJ with an order for 25 aircraft from All Nippon Airways, then targeting a 2013 entry into service.In July 2008, the GTF was renamed PW1000G, the first in a new line of \"PurePower\" engines.",
					"The engine was first tested on the Pratt & Whitney Boeing 747SP on July 11, 2008 through mid-August 2008, totaling 12 flights and 43.5 flight hours. It then flew starting October 14, 2008 on an Airbus A340-600 in Toulouse on the number two pylon.",
					"Testing of the CSeries bound PW1524G model began in October 2010.In addition to the geared turbofan, the initial designs included a variable-area fan nozzle (VAFN), which allows improvements in propulsive efficiency across a range of the flight envelope. However, the VAFN has since been dropped from production designs due to high system weight. The PW1500G engine achieved Transport Canada type certification on February 20, 2013.The first flight test on one of its intended production airframes, the Bombardier CSeries (Airbus A220), was on September 16, 2013.",
					"The A320 engine, the PW1100G, had made its first static engine test run on November 1, 2012, and was first tested on the 747SP on May 15, 2013.The first flight of the Airbus A320neo followed on September 25, 2014. The PW1100G engine achieved FAA type certification on December 19, 2014.The fourth variant of the engine, the PW1900G for the Embraer E2, first flew on November 3, 2015 from Mirabel in Canada fitted to the Boeing 747SP test aircraft.",
					"The program cost is estimated at $10 billion.The list price was $12 million in 2011.At the start of its production in 2016, each GTF was costing PW $10m to build, more than the sale price, but should become less than $2m per engine. MTU provides the first four stages of the high-pressure compressor, the low-pressure turbine and other components. In October 2016, MTU started to deliver the engine assembled on its line to Airbus.",
					"In November 2016, Pratt had fixed the issue of engine start time and wanted to deliver 150 powerplants by the year-end, 50 fewer than originally planned. This was because of low yield of fan blades when less than one-third were passing inspection at the start of the year compared to 75% success for the latest. 350–400 engine deliveries were targeted for 2017. Fuel-burn performance was 16% better than the IAE V2500 baseline, on target, and even 18% better in best cases.",
					"The troubled introduction led to customers choosing the CFM LEAP, which won 396 A320neo orders compared to 39 for the GTF from January through early August 2017: 46% of the GTF-powered A320neos were out of service for at least one week in July 2017 compared with just 9% of those using the LEAP. The GTF's market share fell from 45% to 40% in 2016, but 1,523 planes (29%) were still undecided, and as of August 2017 Pratt had an 8,000 engine orderbook including 1,000 non-Airbus planes. ",
					"On 24 October 2017, a 99.8% dispatch reliability was attained and Pratt remained on track to deliver 350 to 400 engines in 2017, as 254 have been delivered including 120 in the third quarter, but 12–15% were diverted for spares as the carbon air seal and combustor liners were wearing out quickly, requiring engine removals to change the part.P&W expects to deliver over 2,500 GTFs from 2018 to 2020, more than 10,000 engines by 2025.",
					"After 15 PW1200Gs for the Mitsubishi MRJ development were built in Mirabel and Middletown, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries started final assembly in Nagoya in mid 2018 for the MRJ 2020 introduction.Icing, thermal environment, stall, drainage, performance, operability and other development tests were completed.MHI manufactures the combustor and high-pressure turbine disks.The first engine was completed by November 2019.",
					"In 2010, Pratt & Whitney launched the development of an ultra high-bypass version, with a ratio significantly higher than the PW1100G's 12.2:1 for the A320neo, to improve fuel consumption by 20% compared to a CFM56-7 and reduced noise relative to the FAA's Stage 4 by 25 dB.In 2012, wind tunnel tests were completed on an earlier version of the fan and in 2015, 275h of testing were completed on a fan rig.More than 175h of ground testing of key components were completed in October 2017, on a shorter duct inlet, a part of the nacelle and a fan with lower-pressure ratio blades, significantly fewer than the 20 blades of the PW1100G.The US FAA Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program sponsors the tests, with its technologies to be validated in a flight test campaign.It could power the Boeing New Midsize Airplane in the mid-2020s and Airbus' response, and would compete against the Rolls-Royce UltraFan and a CFM LEAP higher-thrust version.",
					"In December 2021, Pratt & Whitney announced an updated GTF Advantage version of the A320neo's PW1100G available from 2024, after over a year of ground and flight testing.It offers 1% more fuel efficiency, more durability and more thrust with 34,000 lbf (151 kN), up to 8% more than before at hot and high airports.This is achieved through more flow into the core; a tweaked active clearance control between the turbine and seals, a reduction of temperature in the high-pressure compressor; improved, more durable coatings and more damage-resistant blisk rotors.Some improvements could trickle down to the other variants.",
					"The family of engines generates 15,000 to 34,000 lbf (67 to 151 kN) of thrust, it uses gearboxes rated between 16,000 hp (12,000 kW) and 32,000 hp (24,000 kW).By putting a 3:1 gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure spool, each spins at its optimal speed: 4,000–5,000 RPM for the fan and 12,000–15,000 RPM for the spool, the high-pressure spool spinning at more than 20,000 RPM.The PW1431G variant has a compression ratio of 42.As the geared fan is slower, the tensile stresses on the blades are reduced, allowing high-strength aluminum alloys.The A320 PW1100G fan has 20 blades, down from 36 in the CFM56-5B.",
					"Pratt & Whitney claims the PW1000G is 16% more fuel efficient than current engines used on regional jets and single-aisle jets, as well as being up to 75% quieter.As the higher bypass ratio and gear leverage a higher propulsive efficiency, there is less need for a high performance engine core than the CFM LEAP, leaving a larger fuel burn gain margin of 5–7% over the next decade, averaging 1% per year combined with gear ratio tweaks. The PW1400G has a cruise Thrust-specific fuel consumption of 0.51 lb/lbf/h (14.4 g/kN/s). ",
					"The 30,000-horsepower (22,000-kilowatt) gearbox is designed as a lifetime item with no scheduled maintenance other than changing oil.It has up to 25,000 cycles LLPs, 25% better than others at 20,000 cycles, reducing maintenance costs, while the fan gear has no limit. The fan drive gear system (FDGS) is expected to stay on wing for 30,000 flight hours or more before it needs its first overhaul.",
					"The first delivery to a commercial operator, an A320neo to Lufthansa, occurred on January 20, 2016.  It entered commercial use later that month.. As of early August 2017, Pratt was supporting 75 aircraft: 59 Airbus A320neos with PW1100Gs and 16 Airbus A220s with PW1500Gs.. In January 2018, it reached 500,000 flight hours on a fleet of 135 aircraft flown by 21 operators.. Due to teething problems, overall losses on the GTF program rose to $1.2 billion.",
					"In May 2018, after receiving and operating five A320neos, Spirit Airlines confirms a fuel burn reduction better than the 15% promised, perhaps by 1%–2%. Air Lease Corporation's A320neos deliveries are 11 months late but its executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy believes 12–18 months will be needed to get back to normal.On 17 July 2018, Pratt & Whitney announced that the PW1500G had been granted ETOPS 180 approval by the FAA.",
					"The first delivery was to Lufthansa instead of Qatar Airways due to rotor bow, or thermal bowing, due to asymmetrical cooling after shut-down on the previous flight. Differences in temperature across the shaft section supporting the rotor lead to different thermal deformation of the shaft material, causing the rotor axis to bend; this results in an offset between the center of gravity of the bowed rotor and the bearing axis, causing a slight imbalance and potentially reducing the tight clearance between the rotor blade tips and the compressor wall. All production standard engines now feature a damper on the third and fourth shaft bearings to help stiffen the shaft and data from engines in service and under accelerated testing is expected to gradually reduce engine start times. According to P&W President Bob Leduc, \"by the time we get to June (2016), it will be down to 200 seconds for start time and by the time we get to December (2016) we will be down to 150 seconds for start time\".",
					"In an earnings briefing on 26 July the CEO of Pratt & Whitney's parent company United Technologies Gregory Hayes stated when asked about the start up issues on the PW1100G-JM; \"On the technical stuff, I would tell you it is in the rearview mirror. The start time with the software drops have been pretty well addressed\". Airbus group chief Tom Enders said while releasing Airbus's 2016 first half financial results that the first upgraded \"golden engine\" would be delivered to Lufthansa in early August 2016.",
					"Initially, the PW1000G start up sequence took about seven minutes, compared to one to two and a half minute startups on the similar CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines; hardware fixes and software upgrades decreased the time required by a little over a minute, and cooling down both engines at the same time saved slightly over two minutes, for a total reduction of three and a half minutes. These modifications were included on new-build engines, as well as retrofitting existing units. Pratt & Whitney continued to improve start up times, with fuel-nozzle modifications and oil filling procedure changes expected to save another minute when introduced by the end of 2017.",
					"To create a better seal and reduce cooling time by 1 min, a cubic boron nitride coating was applied to the 11 integrally bladed rotors  tips: the A321neo production engines start times will be similar to the V2500.",
					"As IndiGo and Go Air operate in a humid, hot, polluted and salty environment, 42 engines were prematurely removed from those companies' aircraft by 24 February, with more removals scheduled, after warnings, mandatory checks, and possible repairs were due after only three flight hours instead of ten. 28 engine removals were due to an air seal leakage in the third bearing, which allowed metal particles to enter the oil system, triggering detectors. Pratt & Whitney discovered these issues in 2015 and revised the design in 2016 after the 160th engine with improved bearing compartments and damping for the third and fourth bearings to offset the rotor-bow, with the repairs retrofitted on-wing after testing at Airbus and Pratt. Boosting durability of the third bearing compartment air seal, the upgraded carbon seal package was certified on April 12 and can be retrofitted over a typical night stop.",
					"Thirteen engine removals were due to borescope inspections revealing blocked cooling holes in combustion chamber panels, apparently due to saltier air, and Pratt & Whitney developed and tested a more durable combustor design to address a tone problem, to be introduced in September.Spirit Airlines reported that the bleed air system froze shut on occasion due to cold temperatures on four of its five A320neos, a problem also experienced by IndiGo, leading Spirit to impose a 30,000 feet (9,100 m) ceiling on their aircraft.  To avoid troubles with the P&W1100G engines, JetBlue Airways switched its first three Airbus A321neos in 2018 to A321ceos, deferring delivery of its first A321neos to 2019 among its order for 60.",
					"In 2017, IndiGo had to ground seven planes, two in May, four in June and one in July after, their engines out of service, waiting for upgrades: a lack of spare parts—grounding also All Nippon Airways and Hong Kong Express Airways A320s—has been compounded by a new Indian tax on goods and services, impeding imports.With removals without sufficient spare engines available, the airline had to ground as many as nine jets on some days, operations disruptions are understood by Pratt & Whitney which struggles to fix glitches and sent compensation while design changes could take a year and sorting out the issue one and a half years.Indigo had to replace 69 engines from mid 2016 till early 2018.",
					"In February 2018, after in-flight failures of PW1100G with its high pressure compressor aft hub modified – apparently problems of its knife edge seal, the EASA and Airbus grounded some A320neo family aircraft until they are fitted with spares. Later, Airbus decided to stop accepting additional PW1100G engines for A320neo aircraft.Despite the part failure that could hold up engine deliveries to Airbus until April, P&W reaffirmed its 2018 delivery goal of doubling its 2017 rate of 374 engines as nearly 100 engines delivered to Airbus are problematic, including 43 in service.",
					"To solve the issue, a revised configuration with a mature and approved design will be released from early March engine deliveries.The EASA and FAA imposed flying A320neos with mixed engines and forbid ETOPS, but the Indian DGCA went further and grounded all A320neo with an affected engine.The design flaw will cost Pratt & Whitney $50 million to resolve.P&W will replace the seals in the 55 engines delivered to Airbus and in the 43 in-service GTFs, as the target of 750 deliveries in 2018 seems more remote.",
					"By September 2018, the A320neo's PW1100Gs were experiencing increasing engine vibrations, sometimes before 1,000 flight hours and mostly at high power settings in the climb phase, requiring an early engine change.Lufthansa's A320neos were grounded 254 days since first delivery, 13 times worse than for its A320ceos, 78% of the time due to engine issues as 14 unplanned engine changes were made. In September 2018 its A320neos utilization was half of its A320ceos.By the end of November, Airbus planned to explain the root cause and give an in-depth analysis by the end of 2018.  Pratt & Whitney stated the A220's and Embraer E2's PW1500G/PW1900Gs are free from the issue and that less than 2% of PW1100Gs are affected while 182 GTF-powered A320/A321neos have been delivered.",
					"In 2018 some engines were reported as emitting \"a strange howling noise\" as heard by people below the aircraft as it made its landing approach. Pratt & Whitney had not established what was causing the noise at that time.",
					"By October 2018 about 10 P&W-powered A320neos were typically grounded for repairs at any given time.",
					"Pratt & Whitney has reduced life limits on PW1500G (installed on the Airbus A220) and PW1900G (installed on Embraer E190/E195-E20) high-pressure compressor front hubs after corrosion was discovered during routine engine overhaul. This corrosion reduces the low-cycle fatigue capability and may lead to cracking before the component reaches its life limit.",
					"In March 2023 Indian operator Go First suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy, initially until May 2023, later until July 2023. The airline cited poor reliability of the PW1100G engines as reason for suspension and claimed that Pratt & Whitney did not comply with a previous arbitration settlement to supply spare engines. Pratt & Whitney disputed the claims.",
					"In July 2023 P&W recalled 1,200 of its 3,000 geared turbofan engines for earlier than expected inspection due to the discovery of contamination in the metal used to manufacture some engine parts with the potential to cause cracks. In September of 2023, P&W updated this recall to include all 3,000 engines, driving 600-700 excess shop visits from 2024-2026 (because most of the engines were expected to have a shop visit anyway during this period). P&W estimated that the metal contamination issue will cost Pratt & Whitney and its partners $6 to $7 billion, 80% of which is customer compensation.",
					"Indian airline IndiGo reported four incidents involving in-flight engine stall during climb followed by shutdown, which occurred on the 24th, 25th and 26 October 2019. The cause of the shutdowns has been traced to problems with the Low-Pressure Turbine (LPT). On 1 November 2019 the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) asked IndiGo to replace engines on all of the 98 A320 Neo airplanes it currently operates by January 31, 2020 and suggested to defer future deliveries until the existing fleet is re-engined. Later DGCA extended the deadline to May 31, 2020.",
					"On 13 October 2018, an Airbus A220-100 operated by Swiss International Air Lines had an inflight shutdown of one of its PW1500G engines after a faulty O-ring seal on the engine's fuel oil cooler led to a loss of oil pressure.",
					"On 25 July 2019, an Airbus A220-300 operated by Swiss International Air Lines had an engine failure and diverted to Paris–Charles de Gaulle. The low-pressure compressor of one its PW1500G engines disintegrated while climbing through 32,000 ft.",
					"On 16 September 2019, a similar accident happened just before reaching 35,000 ft and the crew returned to Geneva. The inspection has shown that \"stage-one rotor in the low-pressure compressor had separated and there was a hole in the compressor case\". On 26 September the FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating borescope inspections on the engines.",
					"On 15 October 2019, another engine failed and the crew diverted to Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Swiss withdrew its fleet for inspection. Swiss returned some aircraft to flight status the same day after engine checks and planned to restore flight operations by 17 October. A software update may cause damaging vibrations of fast-moving parts, causing the failures.",
					"After those engine failures, Transport Canada issued an emergency airworthiness directive limiting the power to 94% of N1 (low pressure spool) above 29,000 ft (8,800 m), disengaging the autothrottle for the climb over this altitude before engaging it again in cruise. For the PW1500G, N1 is the Low Pressure Spool, with a nominal speed of 10,600 RPM, with the fan geared with a ratio of 1:3.0625 (nominal speed 3461 RPM). The top of climb is the most demanding point for a turbofan, where the compressor spins the fastest. The directive states that \"high altitude climbs at higher thrust settings for engines with certain thrust ratings\" may be a contributor to the failures, and cautions that \"this condition, if not corrected, could lead to an uncontained failure of the engine and damage to the aeroplane\". The EASA adopted the directive, and others are expected to follow.",
					"The engines involved in the July and September incidents had 154 and 230 cycles, respectively, while the October failure occurred to an engine with 1,654 cycles since new but within 300 cycles after an electronic engine-control update. Pratt & Whitney recommends inspections on engines with up to 300 cycles after the update.",
					"Another PW1500G suffered an uncontained engine failure, on 12 February 2020 aboard A220-300 belonging to Air Baltic during flight BT-677 from Riga, Latvia to Malaga, Spain ",
					"Following these Airbus A220 PW1500G failures, the similar PW1900G electronic control software was upgraded for the Embraer E195-E2 in 2021.",
					"To address the issue for the PW1500G, Pratt & Whitney developed a software update for the engine control system that was specifically designed to improve engine performance during all flight operations. The update was first approved by the FAA in March 2019, and was subsequently incorporated into the engines of a number of Airbus A220 aircraft. The software update addressed the root cause of the compression stall problem by adjusting the engine's control logic to provide more consistent and stable airflow through the engine core. This was achieved by optimizing the engine's inlet guide vanes and airflow sensors, as well as altering the engine's response to certain flight conditions. ",
					"Pratt & Whitney also conducted a comprehensive review of the PW1500G engine and its components to identify any other potential issues. Extensive testing and data analysis and resulted in further modifications to the engine's design and performance characteristics.",
					"As of June 2023, there have been no other reported incidents of compression stalls on PW1500G-powered aircraft since the software update was implemented.",
					"It has been proposed for the Sukhoi Superjet 130, and the Rekkof Aircraft F-120NG [nl]."

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW2000, also known by the military designation F117 and initially referred to as the JT10D, is a series of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines with a thrust range from 37,000 to 43,000 lbf (160 to 190 kN). Built by Pratt & Whitney, they were designed for the Boeing 757. As a 757 powerplant, these engines compete with the Rolls-Royce RB211.",
					"Pratt & Whitney began working on the JT10D in October 1971 intended for the McDonnell Douglas YC-15 into the Advanced Medium STOL Transport project and the Boeing 767, then code named 7X7, which first ran in August 1974.  In December 1980, Pratt & Whitney changed to a new naming system for its engines and the JT10D became the PW2037.",
					"The PW2000 is a dual-spool, axial air flow, annular combustion, high bypass turbofan with a dual-channel Full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. It was certified in 1984 as the first civilian FADEC-controlled aviation engine.",
					"MTU Aero Engines holds a 21.2% stake in the engine, having developed the low-pressure turbine and turbine exit casing as well as producing critical parts of the low-pressure turbine, the turbine exhaust casing, high-pressure compressor and high-pressure turbine components.",
					"The first PW2000 series engine, the PW2037, powered the Boeing 757-200 and entered service with Delta Air Lines as the launch customer for the civil aviation version of the engine.",
					"Other than the 757, the PW2000 series engines also power the C-17 Globemaster III military transport; the United States Department of Defense designation for the engine is F117, with the specific variant used on the C-17 being the F117-PW-100.  The powerplant first flew on the C-17 in 1991. Still maintaining the F117 engine for the U.S. military, Pratt & Whitney received a $5.5 billion contract modification in June 2023 for engine sustainment in San Francisco, California; Columbus, Georgia; and Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, through September 2027.",
					"The PW2000 also powered the abortive Ilyushin Il-96M; the engine first flew on the Il-96M in 1993.",
					"On October 16, 2008 the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue urgent new inspection procedures on the PW2037 model of the engine, following an uncontained turbine failure event in August 2008. The NTSB recommended that the FAA order PW2037 engines inspected beyond a threshold of flight hours or flight cycles less than that of the event engine, and be reinspected at regular intervals.",
					"The latest build standard, named PW2043, launched in 1994. It provides over 43,000 lbf (190 kN) of thrust. Previous generations of engines can be converted to the PW2043 version."

					"The Pratt & Whitney PW6000 is a high-bypass turbofan jet engine designed for the Airbus A318 with a design thrust range of 18,000–24,000 lbf (80–107 kN).",
					"Pratt & Whitney designed the engine with minimum complexity to significantly reduce maintenance cost and achieve weight and fuel consumption savings. However, tests revealed that the initial five-stage high compressor based design did not meet promised fuel burn performance. As a result, many of the original customers switched their orders to the rival CFM56-5. To address the problem, Pratt & Whitney re-certified an updated design utilizing a six-stage high compressor designed by MTU Aero Engines in order to achieve promised performance. The German company manufactured the high-pressure compressor and the low-pressure turbine. The HP compressor is driven by a single-stage turbine. On the LP spool a three-stage turbine drives a single-stage fan and a four-stage LP compressor.",
					"The engine made its first flight August 21, 2000 on a test aircraft flown from Plattsburgh International Airport (KPBG), successfully completing a 1-hour-20-minute flight. The engine final assembly line is located at MTU Aero Engines at their location in Hanover, Germany.",
					"LAN Airlines confirmed an order for 15 Airbus A318 aircraft, for a total of 34 engines (30 installed and 4 spares) powered by PW-6000 engines on 15 August 2005.

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior is a series of nine-cylinder, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines built by the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company from the 1930s to the 1950s. These engines have a displacement of 985 in3 (16 L); initial versions produced 300 hp (220 kW), while the most widely used versions produce 450 hp (340 kW).",
					"Wasp Juniors have powered numerous smaller civil and military aircraft, including small transports, utility aircraft, trainers, agricultural aircraft, and helicopters. Over 39,000 engines were built, and many are still in service today.",
					"Pratt & Whitney developed the R-985 Wasp Junior as a smaller version of the R-1340 Wasp to compete in the market for medium-sized aircraft engines. Like its larger brother, the Wasp Junior was an air-cooled, nine-cylinder radial, with its power boosted by a gear-driven single-speed centrifugal type supercharger. Its cylinders were smaller, however, with a bore and stroke of .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}5+3⁄16 in (132 mm), giving a 27% lesser total displacement. The Wasp Junior used many parts from the Wasp and even had the same mounting dimensions, allowing an aircraft to easily use either the smaller or the larger engine. The first run of the Wasp Junior was in 1929, and sales began in 1930. The initial version, the Wasp Junior A, produced 300 hp (224 kW).",
					"The U.S. military designated the Wasp Junior as the R-985, with various suffixes denoting different military engine models. However, Pratt & Whitney never adopted the R-985 designation scheme for its civilian Wasp Juniors, identifying them simply by name and model (e.g. \"Wasp Junior A\").",
					"Pratt & Whitney followed the Wasp Junior A with more powerful models in the \"A series\". These had higher compression ratios, greater RPM limits, and more effective supercharging, and they led to the \"B series\". The first B series model was the Wasp Junior TB, which could maintain 420 hp (310 kW) at sea level and could reach 440 hp (330 kW) for takeoff. The TB was tuned for best performance at sea level; it was soon joined by the Wasp Junior SB, which was tuned for best performance at altitude and could sustain 400 hp (300 kW) at altitudes up to 5,000 ft (1,500 m), with 450 hp (340 kW) available for takeoff.  A still later model, the Wasp Junior T1B2, had improved performance at low level, being able to sustain 450 hp (340 kW) up to 1,500 ft (460 m) while still matching the SB's power at high altitudes. The SB and T1B2, and later versions of these with similar performance, were the most popular Wasp Junior models. One later development of the T1B2, the Wasp Junior B4, was especially designed for vertical mounting in helicopters.",
					"During the mid-1930s, Pratt & Whitney developed a still greater improvement of the Wasp Junior, the \"C series\", with an even higher compression ratio and RPM limit. The only type produced in this series, the Wasp Junior SC-G, could sustain 525 hp (391 kW) at an altitude of 9,500 ft (2,900 m) and could produce 600 hp (450 kW) for takeoff. It also included reduction gearing to allow the high-revving engine to drive a propeller at suitable speeds, hence the \"-G\" suffix. Aviator Jacqueline Cochran flew a special Model D-17W Beechcraft Staggerwing with this engine in 1937, setting a speed and altitude record and placing third in the Bendix transcontinental race. However, the SC-G never got past the experimental stage.",
					"Early versions of the Wasp Junior were used in various small civilian and military utility aircraft, but only in limited numbers.  The type became more popular later in the 1930s. It was selected for the Lockheed Model 10A Electra twin-engined airliner, as well as for other small twin-engined civil transports like the Lockheed Model 12A Electra Junior, the Beechcraft Model 18, and the Grumman Goose amphibious aircraft. It was also used in single-engined civilian utility aircraft like the Beechcraft Staggerwing, the Howard DGA-15, and the Spartan Executive.",
					"As World War II arrived, the U.S. military chose the Wasp Junior for the Vultee BT-13 Valiant and North American BT-14 basic training aircraft and for the Vought OS2U Kingfisher observation floatplane. Military versions of existing Wasp Junior-powered civilian aircraft were also produced, such as the military derivatives of the Beech 18, Beech Staggerwing, Grumman Goose, and Howard DGA-15. The Wasp Junior also powered some versions of the British Avro Anson and Airspeed Oxford twin-engined trainers. The demands of World War II led to the production of many thousands of Wasp Juniors.",
					"Until the end of the war, the Wasp Junior's closest competitor was Wright Aeronautical's R-975 Whirlwind. However, during the war, the Wasp Junior was far more widely used in aircraft than the R-975, and Wright ceased production of the R-975 in 1945.",
					"After World War II, many military-surplus aircraft with Wasp Junior engines entered the civilian market. New designs based on the Wasp Junior were also introduced, such as the Sikorsky H-5 helicopter, the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, and Max Holste Broussard bush airplanes, and agricultural aircraft such as the Snow S-2B and S-2C, Grumman Ag Cat, and Weatherley 201.",
					"Pratt & Whitney ceased production of the Wasp Junior in 1953, having built 39,037 engines. Many Wasp Junior engines are still in use today in older bush planes and agricultural planes, as well as in antique aircraft. Some antique aircraft, such as the Boeing-Stearman Model 75, which originally used other engines, have had them replaced with the Wasp Junior to provide more power or for easier maintenance, since parts for the Wasp Junior are readily available.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-1860 Hornet B was a relatively uncommon aircraft engine. It was a development of Pratt & Whitney's earlier R-1690 Hornet and was basically similar, but enlarged in capacity from 1,690 to 1,860 cubic inches (30.5 L). Cylinder bore was increased by 1/8\" and the crankshaft stroke by 3/8\". Both engines were air-cooled radial engines, with a single row of nine cylinders.",
					"The cylinder and valve design was typical for Pratt & Whitney, a simple design with two large valves driven by pushrods. The enlarged engine was designed by George Willgoos and was first available in 1929.",
					"The Hornet series of engines was similar to the Wasp, but larger. In both series a nine-cylinder single-row engine was later supplemented by an enlarged fourteen cylinder engine, with two rows of the same cylinders, but reduced in number to seven per row to aid cooling to the rear row (it was never made into a larger, 18 cylinder radial like the related Wasp was).",
					"Two of these engines, the enlarged single-row Hornet B described here and the R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp was by far the more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the mean piston speed is reduced, the distance the piston has to cover per each engine revolution being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57. This reduced drag, and the relatively large diameter of the Hornet would also have been a serious drawback for visibility if used in a small single-engined aircraft.",
					"Although a technically competent design, the enlarged Hornet B engine was not a commercial success. Customers preferred to buy the R-1830 Twin Wasp instead, which in time became the most numerous aircraft engine ever produced.",

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp is an American twin-row, 18-cylinder, air-cooled radial aircraft engine with a displacement of 2,800 cu in (46 L), and is part of the long-lived Wasp family of engines. ",
					"The R-2800 saw widespread use in many important American aircraft during and after World War II. During the war years, Pratt & Whitney continued to develop new ideas to upgrade the engine, including water injection for takeoff in cargo and passenger planes and to give emergency power in combat.",
					"First run in 1937, near the time that the larger 3,347.9 cu in (54.862 L) competing 18-cylinder Wright Duplex-Cyclone's development had been started in May of that year, the 2,804.5 cu in (45.958 L)  displacement R-2800 was first-flown by 1940, one year before the Duplex-Cyclone. The Double Wasp was more powerful than the world's only other modern 18-cylinder engine, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442 cu in (56.40 L).[nb 1] The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the cylinder-head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head in such a way that the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins.  The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward gear reduction housing - with one of the pair of magnetos mounted between them on most models - and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the \"outboard\" sides of the distributor casings.",
					"When the R-2800 was introduced in 1939, it was capable of producing 2,000 hp (1,500 kW), for a specific power value of 0.71 hp/cu in (32 kW/L). The design of conventional air-cooled radial engines had become so scientific and systematic by then that the Double Wasp was introduced with a smaller incremental power increase than was typical of earlier engines. Nevertheless, in 1941 the power output of production models increased to 2,100 hp (1,600 kW), and to 2,400 hp (1,800 kW) late in the war. Even more was coaxed from experimental models, with fan-cooled subtypes like the R-2800-57 producing 2,800 hp (2,100 kW), but in general the R-2800 was a rather highly developed powerplant right from the beginning.",
					"The R-2800 powered several types of fighters and medium bombers during the war, including the US Navy's Vought F4U Corsair, with the XF4U-1 first prototype Corsair becoming the first airframe to fly (as originally designed) with the Double Wasp in its XR-2800-4 prototype version on May 29, 1940, and the first single-engine American fighter plane to exceed 400 mph (640 km/h) in level flight during October 1940. The R-2800 also powered the Corsair's naval rival, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the US Army Air Forces' Republic P-47 Thunderbolt (which uniquely, for single-engined aircraft, used a General Electric turbocharger), the twin-engine Martin B-26 Marauder and Douglas A-26 Invader, as well as the first purpose-built twin-engine radar-equipped night fighter, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher octane rating (anti-knock value) to give considerably more power. By 1944, versions of the R-2800 powering late-model P-47s (and other aircraft) had a rating (experimental) of 2,800 hp (2,100 kW) on 115-grade fuel with water injection.",
					"After World War II, the engine was used in the Korean War, and surplus World War II aircraft powered by the Double Wasp served with other countries well past the Korean War, some being retired as late as the latter part of the 1960s when the aircraft were replaced.",
					"Engines grow in power with development, but a major war demands the utmost performance from engines fitted to aircraft whose life in front-line service was unlikely to exceed 50 hours flying, over a period of only a month or two. In peacetime however, the call was for reliability over a period of perhaps a dozen years, and the R-2800's reliability commended its use for long-range patrol aircraft and for the Douglas DC-6, Martin 4-0-4, and Convair 240 transports. The last two were twin-engine aircraft of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the DC-4 - itself usually powered by the R-2000 bored-out version of the Twin Wasp - and the first Constellations, which mostly used Wright Aeronautical's large Duplex-Cyclones.",
					"The Double Wasp still flies in restored vintage warbird aircraft displayed at air shows, and sees service worldwide on aircraft such as the Canadair CL-215 water-bomber. In addition, R-2800s continue to power Douglas DC-6 cargo and fuel-carrying aircraft in locations such as Alaska. A total of 125,334 R-2800 engines were produced between 1939 and 1960.",
					"This is a list of representative R-2800 variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Double Wasp. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum \"military\" power that the engine could generate on takeoff and at altitude; 100 Octane fuel was used, unless otherwise noted.",
					"The R-2800 was developed and modified into a basic sequence of subtypes, \"A\" through \"E\" series, each of which indicated major internal and external modifications and improvements, such that the \"E\" series engines had very few parts in common with the \"A\".[citation needed]. Pratt & Whitney's internal variant identification incorporated the series letter as part of the designation, for example Double Wasp S1A4-G (\"A\" series) and Double Wasp CB17 (\"C\" series).",
					"Data from White (Airlife) unless otherwise noted:",
					"The dash number for each military type (e.g.: -21) was allocated to identify the complete engine model in accordance with the specification under which the engine was manufactured. Thus dash numbers did not necessarily indicate the sequence in which the engines were manufactured. For example: the -18W was a \"C\" series engine, built from 1945, whereas the -21 was a \"B\" series engine, built from 1943.",
					"Until 1940 the armed forces adhered strictly to the convention that engines built for the Army Air Forces used engine model numbers with odd numeric suffixes (e.g.: -5), while those built for the US Navy used even (e.g.: -8). After 1940, however, in the interests of standardization, engines were sometimes built to a joint Army-Navy contract, in which case the engines used a common numeric suffix (e.g. the -10 was used by both Army and Navy aircraft.)",
					"The suffix W e.g.: -10W denotes a sub-series modified to use water injection. The \"Anti-Detonant Injection\" (ADI) system injected a mixture of water and methanol into the carburetor to increase power for short periods. Several models of the R-2800s were fitted with ADI as standard  equipment and were not given the W suffix.[nb 2] Few commercial aircraft used water injection.",
					"The following is a partial list of aircraft that were powered by the R-2800 (and a few prototypes that utilized it at one point):"

					"The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II. First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family, and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology.",
					"The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets, but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56).",
					"Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone, first run some seven years earlier (May 1937).",
					"The R-4360 was a 28-cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \"corncob\" nickname. A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds.",
					"The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri. The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required.[citation needed]  Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest.  Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy.  Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era.",
					"Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW). Engines weighed 3,482–3,870 lb (1,579–1,755 kg), giving a power-to-weight ratio of 1.11 hp/lb (1.82 kW/kg).",
					"Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built.",
					"A derivative engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E, was essentially the R-4360 \"cut in half\". It had two rows of seven cylinders each, and was used on the postwar Saab 90 Scandia airliner."

					"The Pratt & Whitney TF30 (company designation JTF10A) is a military low-bypass turbofan engine originally designed by Pratt & Whitney for the subsonic F6D Missileer fleet defense fighter, but this project was cancelled. It was later adapted with an afterburner for supersonic designs, and in this form it was the world's first production afterburning turbofan, going on to power the F-111 and the F-14A Tomcat, as well as being used in early versions of the A-7 Corsair II without an afterburner. First flight of the TF30 was in 1964 and production continued until 1986.",
					"In 1958, the Douglas Aircraft Company proposed a short-range, four-engined jet airliner to fill the gap below its new DC-8 intercontinental, known internally as the Model 2067. Intended to be marketed as  DC-9, it was not directly related to the later twin-engined Douglas DC-9. Pratt & Whitney (P&W) had offered its JT8A turbojet for the airliner, but Douglas preferred to go with a turbofan engine, which would have a greater fuel efficiency than a turbojet. P&W then proposed the JT10A, a half-scale version of its newly developed JT8D turbofan. Development of the new design began in April 1959, using the core of the JT8. Douglas shelved the model 2067 design in 1960, as the targeted US airlines preferred the newly offered Boeing 727.",
					"In 1960, the United States Navy selected the JT10A, designated TF30-P-1, to power the proposed Douglas F6D Missileer, but the project was canceled in April 1961. Meanwhile, the TF30 had been chosen by General Dynamics for its entrant in the TFX competition for the United States Air Force and USN, which was selected for production as the F-111. The version of the TF30 for the F-111 included an afterburner.",
					"The F-111A, EF-111A and F-111E used the TF30-P-3 turbofan. The F-111 had problems with inlet compatibility, and many faulted the placement of the intakes behind the disturbed air of the wing.  Newer F-111 variants incorporated improved intake designs and most variants featured more powerful versions of the TF30 engine.  The F-111E was updated to use TF30-P-103 engines, the F-111D included the TF30-P-9/109, the FB-111A used the TF-30-P-7/107, and the F-111F had the TF30-P-100. ",
					"RAAF F-111Cs were upgraded with the unique P-108 version, using a P-109 engine mated to a P-107 afterburner. The F-111 Engine Business Unit (later taken over by TAE) at RAAF Base Amberley became the world experts on the TF-30 in the years after the USAF retired their fleet and achieved extraordinary increases reliability of the TF-30. ",
					"The TF30 proved itself to be well-suited to the requirements of a high-speed low-altitude strike aircraft with a relatively long operational range, and F-111s in all guises would continue to use TF30s until their retirement.",
					"In 1964, the subsonic LTV A-7A Corsair II won the US Navy's VAL competition for a light attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. The A-7A used a non-afterburning variant of the TF30, which would also power the improved A-7B and A-7C.  In 1965, the USAF selected the A-7D as a replacement for its fast-jet F-100 and F-105 supersonic fighter-bombers in the close air support role. Though the USAF had wanted the TF30, Pratt & Whitney was unable to meet the production timetable, because its facilities were already committed to producing other engines. Instead of producing the TF30 under license for P&W, the Allison Engine Company offered to the Air Force its TF41 turbofan, a license-built version of the RB.168-25R Spey.  The USAF selected the more powerful TF41 for the A-7D, as did the USN, for its similar A-7E.",
					"The Grumman F-14 Tomcat with the TF30-P-414A was underpowered, because it was the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of 1 or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon).  However, due to the intent to incorporate as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant.  The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however, the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA), if the pilot moved the throttles aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.",
					"The F-14's problems did not afflict TF30 engines in the USAF and RAAF F-111s to nearly the same extent. The F-111, while technically designated as a \"fighter,\" was actually used as a ground attack aircraft and tactical bomber. A typical ground strike mission is characterized by less abrupt changes in throttle, angle of attack and altitude than an air-to-air combat mission. While it can still involve hard and violent maneuvers to avoid enemy missiles and aircraft, these maneuvers are generally still not nearly as hard and violent as those required in air-to-air combat, and the F-111 is a larger and less-maneuverable aircraft. Though the F-14A entered service with the Navy powered by the Pratt & Whitney TF30, by the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine, the Department of Defense began procuring F110-GE-400 engines and installed them in the F-14A Plus (later redesignated to F-14B in 1991), which entered service with the fleet in 1988. These engines solved the reliability problems and provided nearly 30% more thrust, achieving a 1:1 dry thrust to weight ratio with a low fuel load.  The subsequent F-14D, a combination of both remanufactured/upgraded F-14As and new manufacture F-14Ds, also used F110-GE-400 engines.",

It was intended to be used in the Vultee XP-54, Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender, Northrop XP-56, Lockheed XP-49, and Lockheed XP-58 Chain Lightning. Projected performance was to be 1,800 to 2,200 hp (1350-1640 kW), with a turbocharger to secure high-altitude performance. The designation came from the intended power rating rather than the more usual cubic inch engine displacement figure.",

Pratt & Whitney subsequently ended development of the X-1800 in October 1940, with only one built, to concentrate on radial engines."

					"The Pratt & Whitney XA101 is an American adaptive cycle engine demonstrator being developed by Pratt & Whitney for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and form the basis for the propulsion system for the United States Air Force's sixth generation fighter program, the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).",
					"The three-stream adaptive cycle design can direct air to the bypass third stream for increased fuel efficiency and cooling or to the core and fan streams for additional thrust and performance. The 45,000 lbf (200 kN) thrust class engine is expected to be significantly more powerful and efficient than existing low-bypass turbofans.",
					"The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy began pursuing the adaptive cycle engine concept in 2007 with the Adaptive Versatile Engine Technology (ADVENT) program, a part of the larger Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) program. While not involved with ADVENT, Pratt & Whitney was selected alongside General Electric for the Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstrator (AETD) program that followed in 2012; this program continued to mature the technology, with tests performed using demonstrator engines. The next step, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), was launched in 2016 to develop adaptive engines for sixth-generation fighter propulsion as well as potential re-engining of the F-35 from the existing F135 turbofan engine. The General Electric demonstrator was designated XA100 and the P&W engine was designated XA101. The AETP goal was to demonstrate 25% improved fuel efficiency, 10% additional thrust, and improved thermal management. In 2017, Pratt & Whitney successfully tested an adaptive three-stream fan with an F135 core, and considered the XA101 to be \"Growth Option 2.0\" in its long-term development plan for the F135. Further contract awards and modifications from Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) in 2018 increased the focus on re-engining of the F-35; there has also been investigations on applying the technology in upgrades for F-15, F-16, and F-22 propulsion systems. In June 2018, Pratt & Whitney changed its development plan for the F135, and instead offered an adaptive three-stream fan as Growth Option 2.0 that is separate from the XA101, which would instead have a new engine core. In 2020, the F135 development plan shifted from \"Growth Options\" to \"Engine Enhancement Packages\" (EEP), while the three-stream XA101 is a new engine with potential re-engining for the F-35A. Ground testing of the XA101 began in September 2021.",
					"Also in September 2021, Pratt & Whitney publicly stated serious doubts about the cost effectiveness of AETP's future for the F-35, stating that the XA101 was \"always intended … to be a sixth-generation [powerplant for sixth-generation fighters].\" Jennifer Latka, Vice President of the F135 program, explained: “There’s a significant amount of risk that comes with brand-new technology, and that would require a tremendous amount of validation to be done. We’re saying, the AETP is not the right fit for the F-35.” Instead, Pratt & Whitney is proposing a \"drop-in\" enhanced engine package that would improve thrust and range by 10% while also offering a 50% improvement in thermal management. While this falls short of the AETP's goal of a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, Pratt & Whitney argues the savings would be worth it, estimating the cost of developing AETP for the F-35 at up to $40 Billion.  As of 2021, thermal management had been an ongoing issue for the F135, largely due to the increased sustainment and maintenance costs caused from heat damage by running the engines hotter in order to take full advantage of newer, more powerful sensors and electronics being integrated into Block 4+ F-35s. The sensors and electronics subsequently require additional cooling to take full advantage of the aircraft's capability.  GE had previously stated that one advantage of their AETP XA100 engine is its third airstream, which its officials say can be used to help cool the F-35’s electronics. Nonetheless, Latka urged an official review of the program's requirements, stating, “We need to crystallize on what the requirement is, and then we figure out what the most cost-effective solution is once we understand that requirement.\"",
					"The XA101 is a three-stream adaptive cycle engine that can adjust the bypass ratio and fan pressure to increase fuel efficiency or thrust, depending on the scenario. It does this by employing a third bypass stream around the entire engine, with the ability to modulate the portion of airflow into the engine core or through this third stream, to increase fuel economy and act as a heat sink for cooling. This capability enables greater use of the high-speed, low-altitude portion of the F-35 flight regime. The increased cooling and power generation also enables the potential employment of directed-energy weapons in the future. When additional thrust is needed, the air from the third stream can be directed into the core and fan streams for increased performance."
